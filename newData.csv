I only have one pair im a size 12 .... i bought them at the mall like 3 years ago grey/white there legit ... but a little snug length wise ...about 4 years ago my feet grew like a half a size and its really hard to find a 12.5 ... i haven't found one yet , i know they have them ....I was gonna buy the New white/black /orange airmax 90 Infered ..... they were probably boot leg but try to pass them off as real and charge legit prices .3/4 of the stuff in thevstore is shitty made clothes ect .. made in China probaly .... they have a few nice name brand clothes you can tell are made better but could just be a better knock off.       Anyway he wantes $130 but said he would take $120 CASH .... the 12's were really tight at first , then he got size 13's wich i hate because the sneakers in that size always look so big and im 6'2&quot; .... then i guess he lossened up all the laces in the size 12 cause i said the 13 are a little big , comfortable but like to long i had too much room from were my toe was ... put back on the 12's and were better , but id have to just tuck in the laces wich i do anyway sometimes, but they were still a tiny bit snug ....Do you know a popular store that would carry size 12,5 ???  Also do you know if these sneakers comne in a larger width size like some do.     I'm in Long Island, Ny thats why i asked a popular store for example FOOTLOCKER , ect .... Or even online ???  I really hate buying sneakers online because i like to try them on first , because certain sneakers are war to narrow for my feet ( I've always just bought a regular size 12 and was good , now i gotta woory about 12 -13 and width )and if theres no free shipping returns its a pain in the ass .

Nike HATES the Light shoe I reckon as they continually fail to talk about it nor really  promote it as I think they don't see it as revolutionary enough to fit the storyline &amp; has never put the Walker back in production &amp;  Remember how the Light wasn't even included in the History Of Air Pack from a few years back? Big speel on the III's AKA 90's(rightly so)but almost nothing on the 180's. Nike obviously knows the love for the 90 now and promotes the crap out of it but it was'nt the Top Dog for long  before the only real innovation the entire line has seen since '87 was introduced with the 180.  Hardly any mention of the IV AKA Classic AKA BW, this shoe was the REAL UK Air Max, forget the talk on the 90's as that didn't happen until the late 90's &amp; re issues, the IV was massively popular everywhere from the get go! Once again a pass over on the ST &amp; the 270 AKA '93  probably because this shoe is a true spiritual successor to the Light &amp; thus just a footnote* in the history *pun intended*. Nothing on the '94, too light on the '95 given the love thus shoe has. No Racer Max, no '96 not enough depth on the '97 the last passable decent looking Max &amp; popular then &amp; now. Nothing on 98' TL, from memory though that one never really was worn by anyone. Plus' hardly spoke about again despite it's massive popularity.  Deluxe's missed, Tuned Max's? Nothing &amp; this is another  rarity that should be highlighted. '03s? No! Then again that was too golf shoe then &amp;  now. Then a skip to that truly awful 2090, hahahaha! Never thought the 270's &amp; 720's would be topped in the ugly stakes, well done Nike.History not His Story.",kolkata,53,56

One I deliberately missed out was the '01 with the weird tubular Air which was at that point the ugliest shoe I think I ever had seen & one I bet Nike really wished they'd never made.",kolkata,47,96

With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may tread me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?

Pumping in my living room.

With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
