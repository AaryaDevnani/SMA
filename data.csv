23,We're boycotting Nike
24,Nike we will boycott you for your anti black treatment of Kyrie. He apologized and you had no reason to cancel him. He has a right to speak and exist like anyone else. Explain how your treatment of Kyrie is in any way fair or just? We will cancel you. #boycottnike
25,They canceled him? This was the most inspiring things I’ve seen in a while idk why they do that this is one if those rare ads I decided not to skip and just watch

THE SIZE 12 WERE A LITTLE TIGHT THE SIZE 13 WERE COFORTABLE BIT I DID HAVE SOME TOE ROOM ..... A 12 1/2 WOULD BE PERFECT. DO THEY CARRY THEM IN A 12 1/2 if i went to FOOTLOCKER or somere like that in the mall ???  And hpw much are they at any reliable store Footlocker ect ... .. im in LONG ISLAND, Ny"
108,"@Brad Kells what do you mean my correct size air units ????     I only have one pair im a size 12 .... i bought them at the mall like 3 years ago grey/white there legit ... but a little snug length wise ...about 4 years ago my feet grew like a half a size and its really hard to find a 12.5 ... i haven't found one yet , i know they have them ....I was gonna buy the New white/black /orange airmax 90 Infered ..... they were probably boot leg but try to pass them off as real and charge legit prices .3/4 of the stuff in thevstore is shitty made clothes ect .. made in China probaly .... they have a few nice name brand clothes you can tell are made better but could just be a better knock off.       Anyway he wantes $130 but said he would take $120 CASH .... the 12's were really tight at first , then he got size 13's wich i hate because the sneakers in that size always look so big and im 6'2&quot; .... then i guess he lossened up all the laces in the size 12 cause i said the 13 are a little big , comfortable but like to long i had too much room from were my toe was ... put back on the 12's and were better , but id have to just tuck in the laces wich i do anyway sometimes, but they were still a tiny bit snug ....Do you know a popular store that would carry size 12,5 ???  Also do you know if these sneakers comne in a larger width size like some do.     I'm in Long Island, Ny thats why i asked a popular store for example FOOTLOCKER , ect .... Or even online ???  I really hate buying sneakers online because i like to try them on first , because certain sneakers are war to narrow for my feet ( I've always just bought a regular size 12 and was good , now i gotta woory about 12 -13 and width )and if theres no free shipping returns its a pain in the ass .  SORRY FOR THE BOOK I WROTE ANY HELP WOULD BE AWSOME , I ALWAYS LOVED AIR MAXES BUT REALLY HUST FELL IN LOVE WITG THEM CAUSE I CAN NOW AFFORD TGEM , BEFORE I HAD TO PRIORTIZE MY MONEY FIRST !!!!  -   THANKS SO MUCH !!!!"

186, It is the worst shoe and the stupidest idea for shoes on the face of the earth .. Because I bought several years ago the Air Max shoes and when I went and friends on the way to the cinema I walked by mistake on a nail that was lying on the floor and suddenly the air was emptied from the inside of the shoe and I became walking and limp and my shape became embarrassing in the street .. Since that day I have been sharing all of my acquaintances and friends and social media with this disastrous experience with this stupid shoe so that a small nail in the street makes it useless.

297,90’s are good 97’s are better and bw’s are the best.
298,Exactly same as me first air max were 90’s in 1990 and have worn a pair ever since despite having other Max’s the 90’s are always my go to

304,"Yeah, thats an issue. I also invested my first earned money into a sneaker. Jordan 7 Bordeaux back then. The conclusion from this buy was clear By any means, have some fresh kicks."
305,"Merry Air Max Day people  Cool insight into the new silhouette, I'm surprised it didn't drop in a remixed OG Infrared colourway though. I know it's not the activation for the time yet, but I'm intrigued to know what's coming for 95's as well. There's been a lot of sick in-house Air Max colourways designed over the past year, but I'm looking forward to seeing what collabs hold in store this year, the Sk 5 on a Tailwind 5 sounds like certified  I think you should get Kendrick on Air as well, he'll bring some sick concepts to the table."

311,"Hey chicken babe, how are you? ;)"
312,What I truly LOVE in the Air Max sneakers beyond its incredible design is their durability!  I bought Air Max 90 5 years ago and they are still fine !
313,I'm glad Nike makes these kind of videos it will help the next generation hundreds of years later of kids to be inspired good job NIKE!
314,"Just bought my first pair of Air Max's today, they were the 90's.. so here I am learning a bit. Just wanted to say that the lady talking about working in mental health & having the designs on her wall brought a tear to my eye. All the respect "
315,"Nothing in my life resonates with me more than my AirMax 90 when it comes to the material goods I own. There is an engrained cultural and socio-economical heritage that just reminds me of my past, the present and the future. These are more than shoes to me. More than iconic. They are truly historic in all facets of life."
316,"So, so much memories with these shoes, from my childhood (kids on the playground bragging and struggling to get a pair). Into my teens, (impressing friends and girls, party's and skateparks). Into my twenties (party's, love, heartache, funerals and weddings). Until my thirties now, passing the love down to my own kids. These shoes have been a huge part of my life, my culture, my generation, our identity. I truly fell in love with these shoes. The love for these shoes will be past down to the next generations, not because we want that to happen but because These shoes are fire!"
317,"I’m remember getting my first pair of Air Max’s I was 15 years old, now I’m 44 years old, and they are still and Air Max’s will be  4 Ever"
318,Thats crazy im 15 rn and im about to get my first air max its the recycled ones
319,"Thank you for sharing this Nike. For some, these sneakers are an essential part of life. Even if we have wear 'em inside now. The work of your company, from designer to shop employee, make our days brighter. And our feet shinier! Thank you!"
320,Loved this! Very thorough! I am an AIR MAX nut!!!! It's crazy - I am have been buying and rocking the 90s for 12 months now only because I wanted different colorways than the  Vapor Max I have. Air Max Plus blows my mind! I love those along with the Vapor Maxes! I had been buying Jordans for 7 yrs straight until 2019!
321,Still remember my first steps in an Air Max! It felt unreal and perfect. Totally new feeling. 
322,"I love the air max 90 and the simple appearance of it. Affordable and good looking and its stood through the testament of time, still find it hard to see how amazing a viable air unit is. In only 19 so I showing my age, I think the 2090 isn't a hitter though it has too much going on"
323,Really cool and interesting video about iconic Nike sneakers! Also loved the cinematography especially the outdoor shots 
324,I Love this vid! I have 70+ AirMax and now I get to watch my children step out in the same sneakers I grew up loving!!The 90s and 95s are my fav!!
325,tn's australia's fave max since the late 90s early 00s till now even nike back in the day where shocked at how well australia embraced them some of the most limited tn's hit footlocker shelves that never made it anywhere else in the world was the ultimate hood sneaker in sydney espically i remember first time i seen the hyper blue tn at the locker was a massive game changer in the air max line long live the tn
326,I love all my air max 90's. Constant compliments and it's a fantastic shoe for my flat feet.
327,I’d love to work for Nike and design sneakers like Air Max with them and just be involved in creating sneakers cause of the story each sneaker tells and the culture around each type of sneaker
328,"I wasn't even alive when the air max 90 dropped, but I just wanted to say that it has rightfully earned it's spot in the hall of Fame."
329,Air max is the first Nike sneaker I bought. It gave me unique steps apart from others.I really enjoy it.
330,Remember first saw red and white air max 1988. Absolutely bkew me away.  Groundbreaking moment in the trainer world /market. Always be legendary shoe.  
331,The Infrared Air Max 90s got me hooked into sneakers around 2006. Still my favorite pair and Air Max model
332,The Air Max 90 Infrared is at the Top-3 of the most beautiful sneakers ever.
333,Yep the original colourway 
334,I remember when i copped my first pair of 90’s.. fell in love instantly.. thank you nike
335,"30 years of Nike Air Max 90, moving production. Brings back good memories."
336,"Great video. Learned a lot, including how much of a staple Air Max were in grime & gabber."
337,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say anyone that both watched and commented is a Air Max sneakerhead and clearly has exquisite tasteTinker is a living breathing Legend
338,The Air Tuned Collection for me is my favorite and easily misunderstood by the many usually people think TN and think hood but it's actually got sick designs
339,My all time Fav pair is the 2007 - Alphabet pack (AM1’s) straight  and great memories from coming to London as a kid and seeing people wearing them.
340,This is a true Love story to Airmax! My favs were 95s since 95 lol. But within the last few years I have changed to 97s. I don't care what colorway.  Airmax will ALWAYS reign supreme.
341,Funny 90’s growing up story My mom once told me that I couldn’t have “Nike air’s” I could only buy “Nike’s” cuz the airs are too much.  Explaining that they are one and the same was mind blowing for her
342,"Merry Air Max Day people  Cool insight into the new silhouette, I'm surprised it didn't drop in a remixed OG Infrared colourway though. I know it's not the activation for the time yet, but I'm intrigued to know what's coming for 95's as well. There's been a lot of sick in-house Air Max colourways designed over the past year, but I'm looking forward to seeing what collabs hold in store this year, the Sk 5 on a Tailwind 5 sounds like certified  I think you should get Kendrick on Air as well, he'll bring some sick concepts to the table."
343,"Crazy how I still choose an Airmax 90 to be on my feet all day over my Reacts, Ultraboosts, ZoomX. Just the right level of comfort and stability that my feet like."
344,"Yea, its crazy how comofortabel they are, although I find my 95s more comfortable."
345,"I ordered my 2090 pair an hour after it went live. Excited to see where they take me.Thanks, Will"
346,I’m probably in the minority!  Favorite is the Air Max 180 Ultramarine!  .  My 2018  of the year was the 180 CDG.  The black/pink color way on the 180 silhouette are   Only wished I bought three more pair!  Loved those!  Classic.
347,Love Documentaries like these
348,My most favorite air max is the BW. My first of these were black with gold. I was a teenager then. I have to admit that I did like it when I was told that it looked cool on me. I was able to buy the Nike air max Classic BW (Marina). I keep them mostly for parties and going out.
349,this has that vibe like something a teacher would make you watch in class
350,https//youtube.com/shorts/pX3aS_lmyuA?feature=share
351,I have to watch this in class rn 
352,HAHAH my teacher just assigned us to watch this for my sports marketing class
353,"Can confirm, I have to watch this video for a stem project."
354,@Brodey wong consoomer
355,@Yellow Jell-O oro
356,How you know that
357,But this is actually cool or interesting
358,If my teachers let me watch this then they would be my favourite teacher ever
359,I wish my teacher made me watch this.
360,My design teacher makes us watch vids like these haha
361,Leave them kids alone...
362,Science Teacher
363,I recall my first time trying them 90s on damn! This is the most comfy shoe I have EVER tried on my foot
364,"Happy Air Max Day!  As having just turned 47, I HAVE HAD THEM ALL!! And have loved every single one of them "
365,"love the styles everyone is rockin here, AM is such a versatile shoe"
366,Just got my Air Max 90 slides today. Something so amusing about the shoe being reborn into a flip flop was just too much for me to pass up. Recently Nikes have been somewhat hit or miss for me. But the AM 90 never misses.
367,I grew up with 95's being called 110's. Feel like that's the UK's stamp on that shoe and Dizzy cemented it in history in this documentary.Edit Not actually sure if 110's started in the UK but growing up I thought it was just in our neighborhood that existed.
368,Was a pleasure to be a part of this movie. Thanks @ Nike!
369,I remember when these came out back when I was in grade 3.  The air bubble was wild back then!
370,Love Air Max. 97 and 90 are my favourite 
371,Air Max have always been my favorite type of sneakers no cap!
372,The air Max bw will always be my favorites because they're the first joints that all the hoods rocked heavy
373,All white leather Air Max 90. The first sneaker I ever bought with my own money and it was what started my passion for both sneakers and fashion.
374,Air Max was the shoe that started my love for shoes
375,As a man who loves shoes I needed this video thank you 
376,"Amazing history, I can't wait to get my first Air Max sneakers "
377,"I was too young to experience this sneaker game. Although I do have stories and connections to the Yeezy 350s that come out, it should be more accessible like the Air Max collection."
378,Others Gives long ass speech about air maxesMe Theyre comfy AF
379,@Mostafayoff - مصطفيوف  I did that but I didn't stop buying them lol
380,Mostafayoff - مصطفايوف  your opinion but it is comfortable
381,Mostafayoff - مصطفايوف  So because instead of walking around it you stepped on it huh... if it popped your bubble that means if you’re wearing other shoes that’s gonna be your foot dude.
382,@Mostafayoff - مصطفيوف  only because you are too stupid to walk straight you blame the shoe...
383,Jamie Whitehouse the air max culture vs the “sneaker” culture are different things. The sneaker culture now is resale. People dont appreciate shoes as people did. Shoes are shoes but now days shoes are a source of income.
384,"It is the worst shoe and the stupidest idea for shoes on the face of the earth .. Because I bought several Air Max shoes a few years ago, and when I went and friends on the way to the cinema, I mistook on a nail that was lying on the floor and suddenly the air was emptied from the inside of the shoe and I became walking, limping, and my shape became embarrassing in the street .. Since that day I have been sharing all of my acquaintances and friends and social media  with this disastrous experience with this stupid shoe so that a small nail in the street makes it useless."
385,Then you aint apart of the culture my brother
386,and they look dope
387,"I love 90s, who doesn't, but the 93 are criminally slept on."
388,Had these back in the day! Maybe I’ll share the picture one day
389,"""We're not growing up in this time."" Made me remember I cannot never judge this generation..."
390,This generation sucks
391,"Thank you for this video gift, it is a gem and I would see it again!  "
392,I hope y'all can put more content out like this
393,First pair I bought myself was a pair of premium air Max 1s which I rocked almost every day for a year. My birthday also lands on air Max day which makes them even more special
394,I got goosebumps when I heard how much they appreciate sneakers as much as I do.
395,It ain’t that deep
396,AirMax is a culture of all people..it wasn't one that made the sneaker more popular or cool to wear..I come from a melted pot of 3 major cities from 3 different states in 1 with population of 100k and music was not influenced by our street wear..it was the style and colors of Air Max...AIR MAX 4EVER
397,Air Max 90's and 97's will always be my favourite
398,I share the same favorites as ya

430,"The fact that all of them are rocking colorways of AM90, my favorite silhouette. "
431,"In London they were being worn on the streets as soon as they came out, which was long before the Grime scene emerged. Would have been nice to have mentioned the Hardcore/Jungle/Drum&Bass scene."
432,I love how they skipped the 270s because they look exactly the same as the new 2090 (but without the 90 ripoff)
433,"Happy Air Max Day Yessssss!!!!!!!!, They Are Fire "

439,"More content like this! & How can we, the consumers get involved?"
440,This air max will be forgotten nothing beats 90- TN 2000 era
441,The 90 is also a staple in hardcore-punk scene as well
442,The BWs are the best design ever. @Nike bring them back and keep them updated. Bring them to Nike iD
443,"they're all dope. my 1st pair was in 1990 I bought Air max 90's LE (limited editions)  all leather, white leather with black details and light grey. Dope. Bought my first pair of classics in 2012,  reissues from HK Fa yuen street, navy blue with cheeta prints.Today bought MX-720-818's with tech pack trim, I hope they feel good, slept on a pair of 95's in armoury blue."

446,"I just remember in the 90s at high school EVERYONE wearing all kinds of AIR MAX. You had a few that wore Rebok Hexalite but it was mostly Air Max. I remember my first pair at 14 i saved for and then the most expensive was £120 unlike today the VaporMax Plus sits around £200 all the time, well the pair i got was the most expensive and the comfort levels were off the chart. I think something has changed though as of 2010 i have yet to get that same comfort feeling with a new design.They are extremally popular here in the UK"

492,@Nike  We Dutch people need our Air Max Classic/BW. Please start producing and selling them again. They aren't for sale anymore as from the 2018s. Its 2020 and I wrecked my last pair and only walked 3 months on them due to a production fault. You should considder cooperating with Id&amp;T and create some special ones directed to our Dutch &quot;gabber&quot; culture!My top 31. Air Max Classic/BW2. Air Force Max (OG)3. Air Force 180 (OG)I've recently bought a pair of Air Force Max CB2 Hyperfuse from 2013. They are great and lucky I was still able to get them from a kind of hidden store who had 1 pair left.

497,"Wish they would have spent more time talking about design aesthetics and less glorifying the shoe as if it is something divine...And they just totally glossed over the 2090's instead of talking about the how's and why's of the design...Oh well, a nice 24 minutes either way..."
498,1209Best looking Air Max ever IMO.

519,Been waiting for any news on the airmax 90 bacon & am90 undefeated platinum colorway. I cannot find release dates or where to cop. I bought the black pair directly from undefeated because Nike was sold out. My favorite sneaker is an airmax . I'm a collector of airmax & retro jordans. I got about 150 pairs. I started collecting March 2019. I've worn them since the early to mid 90s
520,Pretty sure I've heard the bacon 90s are not being released at the moment so are probably cancelled or delayed (
521,"I love air max , I woukd like it if they made a version with a less chunky heel"
522,"Pretty sure my first pair of nike air was a psir of my uncles old cross countries in 94 i was fourteen. I was ten in 90, no way my parents we're buying me branded trainers. The company my dad worked for was going through strikes for many years so me looking stylish wasn't important keeping the house was. I do t actually remember my first pair of nineties around 2000 i think. Easily my favourite trainer style recently made better imo by the terrascape line. Cannot wait for a pair of those."
523,"When that 95 Air Max hit the hood (East Coast) and I saw a pair  on a young woman feet, I said those are  She balling she got paper that's how they looked."
524,Happy Air Max Day World!  San Francisco in a pair of Infrared Max 1s. Quarantine or Not

544,"Agreed. Where was the air max 360, 24-7, LTD, tailwind, solas, TL, just to name a few"
545,Thank you! I just said near the same but in a rant but good to know someone else is questioning why 
546,Air maxes are the shit 
547,"Just rock the classics, the 1, 90, 93, 95, 98, BW, Commands, Ivo's...Not a huge fan of how the ones look, they're hard to wear with Jeans and stuff but the technology is amazing no doubt."
548,"The only problem I have with air max shoes is, they are always out of stock in every webshop in my country. The air max 90's."
549,"I've got this love/hate relationship with my 90's. I love wearing these, I hate they came from child labor."
550,@Duncan 1 It's sad we should be able to change it
551,it’s sad the thing is most companies use child labour and it’s something about the world that i guess we can’t change
552,"My favorite Air Max sneaker is 97 premium black.. and I have also Air Max 270 react.. I won't lie.. They are fire.. only pairs of these in my school.. as I bought a 97's Premiums.. everybody was like ""What are those!?"" soon enough I started a trend in my school and I can tell that my Premiums are just like me.. simple, fasionable, uniqe ( <-- not sure if I write it correct).. Happy Air Max Day everyone D"
553,The greatest pair of trainers ever air max 90
554,"Hi! I got some types of air max but the most comfortable is the air max oketo.I use it 10-12 hours/day and not hurts my feet, soft and light."
555,those are good ones especially when first trying air max. all though they arent as expensive like the others still a great and stylish shoe
556,Dick Knight I am sure is so proud from his waffle design shoes to the cultural impact his shoes have made. Not bad for an accounting major.
557,"Growing up in the bay area back in the 80s way before Nike. Having shoes gave all us poor peeps individual swagger and style. We rocked Troops,BK,Diadora and le coq sportif just to name a few. That was the only thing made us different from one another. No one had the same shoes too. EAch person had to have a different syle if not colorway. Now that Nike has wiped the average mind. Cus the swoosh aint nothing but a whip in mid swing. Everyone rocking the same shit and trying to be like the next tool off instagram. Sad how things have turned out. I still have shoes from back in the days. I have OG colorways from back in the days. I laugh at the kids and whites at footlocker that say things like love your retros. When they not retros hahahha or I see you like cortezs like its my first pair. I've owned prolly 50 pairs since my gangbanging days of the 80s."
558,"I first saw the airmax 95's in 9th grade; someone in the 10th grade were wearing them. From that day forward, I fell in love with that silhouette and did everything I could to learn about sneakers. Coppin' my first pair of 95's in 12th grade was a great feeling. Been workin' hard and finally had enough money to cop em myself. Still waiting for them to release the neons!"
559,Airmax 96 OG ones not the retro ones.. and Tailwind IV ! The best air maxes in history.
560,i enjoy it and love it
561,1611 where the arrow points and says first fully foamless air max is where the shoe had a flaw. After a month of use the connection broke.
562,They should bring back some of the styles of the late 90's back like the ACG Air Terra Ptarmigan
563,I love air max!!! wow~!
564,"It is a shame that they didn't feature Australia. Australia easily has one of if not the biggest Air Max hype. Beats Jordans, Adidas, Asics, any day of the week. TN's alone I would say have the biggest hype here than anywhere else in the world."
565,Fr the full history of air max is global. Europe and Australia and Japan are everything to the history of Air max
566,Well Nike you have still 70 years time to call it Airmax 2090...  wtf
567,"Nike story as a startup is so interesting. I did a video on it if someone is interested to know more, let me know! Congrats!"
568,"My favorite shoe line ever! Way better than overplayed converse, or vans."
569,NIKE AIR MAG - The greatest sneakers of all times
570,Now do one about ALL the Nike Air Force series and ALL the Nike Delta Force series!!!!!
571,I haven't wore a pair of Air Force One's in a decade
572,"Honestly speaking I think we need a completely new take on the air max instead of a revamped version of the og, I do appreciate the design but at the end of the day it’s a pass not hatin just my opinion Nike please we need something new !!!!! ."
573,"Air Max 90 and 95s over Jordan anytime of the day. And yes, I'm a Jordan sneakerhead to."
574,In amsterdam air max 90's will never be out of fashion!!
575,Awesome story mannn
576,"What about the most forgotten & under-rated AM, the AM Light, just totally goes under the radar. Also the Air 180 barely got a mention & the AM ST was also not even mentioned? These are iconic AM's from the golden era/age. Thought this video was meant to be The Story Of Air Max?"
577,"in the years 1995 96 97 98 99 00 and 2001 I always had nike air maxthen other shoes came, other brands and I haven't bought air max for yearsbought a few classics in 2010 / 2011 and then again for 10 yearsbut since yesterday bought a pair of nike air 90s again and from now on i will stick with it no more shoes on my feet than air max 90 in the coming years"
578,"I usually skip 30 seconds adds, just watched 24 minutes ad. Nike got game!"
579,If i could wear any sneaker forever it'll be the airmax 90 (i just ordered the hyper royal)
580,Scoop Jackson talking from his heart ..
581,"Most desirable Nike releases these days are retros or new colorways of old shoe designs. T Scott, Virgil, Jordan's, etc.The 2090 are not in the same league as any 90s Airmax. They dude saying this generation doesn't have their own shoe is wrong. We do but it's not coming from Nike. From a creativity standpoint - the yeezy line is beyond anything Nike has done since the 97."
582,Going of subject I brought a pair of r4 shox recently 
583,2219 This chick got the same VM360s that I do. 
584,"Ahh....!! Airmax 97 still this day is my favourite. I remember back in 97 when it first came out. I couldn't convince my parents to buy me a pair. Especially in Indonesia, price is slightly more expensive for some reason. I was only 15 years old. Now I'm 40."
585,BW Classics are the shoe for me.. Raves at 14 n worn ever since...
586,Air Max 93 the best of all time
587,"yup, complete with monochrome screen & shitty keypad"
588,@Tenamsal Sangma you know damn well he didnt get a laptop just to design some running shoes what software did it come with  Microsoft paint lmao
589,laptop was invented in 81' so..
590,"Why isn't  the OG Airmax 2 , Airmax Lite never mentioned ?  imo the best looking Nike Airmax ."
591,"I have bought the all black 2090 air max and the pure platnum shown in the video. They are super comfortable and I feel like a badass while wearing them, even though I know I'm not.lol!!!"
592,"SHAME THE AIR UNIT GOT SO SMALL, BACK IN THE 90'S THE AIR UNIT WAS WAY BIGGER, ESPECIALLY ON THE 180'S, NIKE PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD AIR UNIT "
593,"Wish they gave the same speech and attention to nature, animals and the earth. I’m a sneakerhead but Nike is super commercialized and we should teach young people about Mother Nature not to make people think that wearing AM90 is OG."
594,I stan for my sis Scottie Beam!!! 
595,Viewed this 2x on accident but I’m getting one of these shoes one day
596,visit the nike store while watching this... well played nike...edit now i am happy owner of air max 90 slides...
597,"Hearing how the shoes came up in these ""influencal cities"" is cool but for 90% of people who didn't live in these cities I couldn't give a fuck about the city or shoe I just like the shoe since it looks good. Also since these shoes are so old like the 95 the 90 the 97 than eventually their gonna get lost in time. Is it a big deal if the 95 was the first shoe to have a black midsole?"
598,Set a reminder and watch the premiere with us later today!
599,eyy Nike why is my Air Jordan 34 are getting water inside on the silver circles every time i step in water on the outsole
600,Eyy nike why is my air jordan 34 are getting water on the multiple silver circles of the outsole
601,"Air max is the only shoe I wear, I even designed my own on the site"
602,1536 thats fire
603,Have the 2090s in Chile Red 
604,"i  dont like the 2090 to be honest, it looks like a degrade when compared to 720"
605,@corsinivideos yeah 2090 looks like its half finished don't know if they did like that on ourpose
606,"Both garbage imho.  Problem is if we are being perfectly honest these newer designers don't have the vision or  attention to detail that hatfield, lozano and others had on these iconic shoes. Far too gimmicky looking and disjointed, also lack proper paneling and the structure these legendary air maxes had."
607,Love my 720s. Whoever says they aren't comfy is smoking dick lmao. they are great and futuristic looking. not saying they are the best or whateva but they are definitely slept on a lot
608,The air Max 200 is my favorite
609,I love the 97s and 2090s
610,"2021 Classic BWs, please..."
611,Yeah! I need some persian violet in my collection! Best looking Air Max ever IMO.
612,My first shoe was a air max 90 kids and was size 3.5 now I wear size 10
613,Love this video
614,"Who remembers the Nike Air Max FORCE 180, Charles Barkley shoe....... Bring that back"
615,"In my neighborhood, the only Air Max i would see was on criminals and drug dealers, so i never wanted them."
616,"As a born in the 80s raised in the 90s kid, I never really liked the look of the Air Max 90s. I preferred high tops, but times change and as one matures so do our tastes. Music that I never paid attention to in my childhood and food that I hated I now like today. Likewise the 90s are now my favourite sneaker."
617,These shoes mean so much to me
618,I will be a professional football player and develop my own collection with NIKE one day.
619,"Nike WaterNike EarthNike FireNike AirLong ago, the four elements lived in a shoe....."

633,"I absolutely love my all black 270s, I have the wolf grey and all white 2090s which I can see being an icon of the 20s and beyond"
634,"True but they look quite big, a friend of mine wears 2090's in a size 9. If I put my vans in next to his nikes it looks like I have midget feet though I wear a size 9 as well "
635,air max 90 new species. hands down
636,Clark said it all “the people decide if it’s a classic” - nice film but those 2090’s are wack! When you see a kick and the endorphins pop - you gotta winner.
637,Air Max Plus (TN) definitely!
638,The Problem is that how do these guys keep their shoes so clean
639,"What colorway of the 90 is Clark Kent wearing?!?,"
640,Seriously... need to know
641,How about releasing the persian violet BW and Lazer blue 90's again PLEASE
642,Yeah! Persian Violets were the shoes of my generation.
643,Never knew sneakers from the US were so popular around the world.
644,"Have never had a Nike AirMax 90 what do are your reviews , I am thinking of getting one"
645,Jordan Bolt Cuz they’re the worst AMs ever
646,Please bring back 90 essentials
647,90's!!!
648,nice video  would have liked  a little more history though
649,Airmax is my favorite of all tym
650,this is a great vid but the quality of the current shoes r just terrible
651,prod chui yeah its quite annoying. those terrible weird “new generation airmax” are everywhere.. where i cant find the amazing air max 90s (im only 18 not some guy of some age)
652,Happy air max day! Happy birthday Seth Fowler!
653,Went from running shoe to flockin shoe.
654,The true story is their treatment of employees and consumers. I’ve dedicated 3 years to this “company “... The mighty shall fall.
655,"Got 97 for my 9th bday, expensive but mother saved up some money, and was able to wear them once to the pool where my bday party was with 10 friends... when changing again in the big shared lockerroom gone were my 97s, never ever i got the precious gems again cuz ppl get jealous... haha so sad"
656,Air Max 97/1 Sean Wotherspoon. THE BEST OF ALL TIME.
657,"Designing sneakers, Best job in the world for any sneaker OG"
658,"2337 If your only rule is to break the rules, that means you shouldn't break a rule."
659,"Nike air max 90 2020 infrared! My favourite sneaker of all time, let alone Nike sneaker lol, easiest question i've ever had to answer, i'm OBSESSED with them!"
660,Air max 95s the best by far
661,INFRAREDS PLEASE!
662,I was 20 when the og pair came out..no one in the hood wore them..then the dope boys and runners started the trend. Hated em..love em now.
663,I live in the uk so every time I see a 95 or 97 it just looks like a roadman shoe
664,My FAVORITE Model Shoes  -THe 90' classic  <3 Are you OK? Like !!
665,Didnt know he was a high carb vegan!
666,Thats what you take from this?
667,Just ordered a pair customized them myself black base and sole with a blue and gray top!! Cannot wait!!
668,95s for life.
669,Air Max 97 is my personal favourite.
670,"1707 on the right wall, is that what i think it is?"
671,Notice how nobody talks about the shoes performance as an actual runner! Why? Because these shoes were nearly useless unless you weighed 180+ because the air bladders were encapsulated in think urathane and had a super stiff forefoot. I personally sold far more Pegasus to real runners...we never brought out Air Max for a true runner. The shoe clearly made it supporting the DJ/art culture!   Nike should do docs forthe original Air Trainer and the Agassi. How about a doc on Pressure?
672,One of the coolest shoes ever created.
673,Mine fave airmax are the airmax 95s.
674,1555 agreeeeeeeeee
675,Nike stays living in the past
676,how the hell you not going to have Tinker speak smh... great video tho!

688,I love my air verisitle III.
689,They look like a mix of the 200s and 270
690,This generation does have a shoe. It's called a Yeezy.
691,"@Dimitrije Tucović i like the 750s and the v3 AzealCoild use foam runners as crocs, very expensive ones for that"

697,1130
698,Airmax 98 Modular! Still hunting for a pair...
699,Team Nike all the way
700,"You know someone is from Liverpool when they are wearing air max 95's I guarantee Liverpool in the UK has bought the most Nike air Max 95's in the world that shoe is part of our culture! Seeing Liverpool FC kits are going to be Nike next season whenever that bloody is with what's going on in the world right now, Nike need to do a air max 95 Liverpool design"
701,I wonder how these people got where they are? (besides hard work) like how do you just become the top nike designer?
702,I wish I could know more. is there designated teams for track suits? then shoes? then outewear? then colour ways? or is it a small team that does it all? AHHH
703,The french accent of that juliana girl is so obnoxious I can't stand it. And I'm french urgh
704,"My shoe collect is all air maxes, 270’s, tailwinds, tns and tnIII"
705,90s air max all time
706,AIR MAX IS THE BEST!!
707,I'm different fsr where you at
708,"Air max 95, air max 97 and air max plus. Thats it"

710,Bro my 90's are coming in a few days
711,The leather in sneakers in the old days looked real and felt real...today the leather sneakers feel like fake leather...
712,"Why do they itw a DJ, an influencer, etc? That's ridiculous, I wanna Nike designers to tell me stories, not a random guy. Anyway, I wish they didn't kill the Air Max Big Window. That's my favorite shoe and it's impossible to find at a reasonable price now. (I managed to keep one yellow/black in pretty good shape tho before they disappeared."

722,"2090 will never beat the classic Air MAX 90, problem with a lot of modern sneakers they look super plasticy."
723,If it ain't Broke Dont Fix It AIR MAX 96
724,Am 1 / 90 / BW / 180In OG colour ways are all I care about
725,In my part of Dubkin we called 95s turtle max
726,I've the 2090s and hands down they look cool but I feel they lack some snugness in middle and towards the back of the shoe coz I always feel like my feet is sliding towards front of the shoe. They need to do a face-lift or something coz the shoe's grip and snugness needs to be uniform in front mid and back.
727,"The 2090s are trash, pure basura bruh"
728,do 2090s give more height than 90s?
729,just receive my og 90 today......thats what brought me here hahahahahahahhaha personally it stops after 1998 and tn's......for me
730,had the 2090 for like 3 weeks already lmaoshoutout to finish line
731,Man said this new generation doesn’t have a signature shoe!?!?? It’s called the airforce
732,...Airmax 1’s ...95’s...97’s. The best Silhouettes.... but what they need to do now is figure a way for them soles not to crumble ....  best shoe of all time I’m my opinion...
733,"wow, very cool !"
734,I wonder what would happen if someone forgot to wear a pair of Nikes when going to work...
735,BWs need to be released to the world one of the best trainers ever and 110s haven't been 110 for a long time
736,But it goes  BWs 1st then 95s 2nd and 91s 3rd there is no other order......
737,"bruh check it, tupac had the og am90s on in the trapped video off his first album in 1991. 'hood' people did wear air maxes then"
738,you know you're a boomer when you say corny lol
739,Why does Nike always leave out the Air Max IV?
740,Air Force 1 is knocking
741,"""See it as a personality"".....has the world gone mad?"
742,I agree air max is iconic. There is is silhouette or color way for everyone. If you don't like one you can bet you can find one
743,who did the design the girl or the director??? you only have a creator that DESERVE TO BE MENTIONED....
744,please please please please bring back the BW classics
745,My airmax97 ultra17 is back to fashion thx to 30th anniversary

752,Need to talk more about tns and it’s popularity in aus
753,"017 what sneakers is this , someone let me know the name please"
754,"Nike should pay attention to their own ad campaign. What comes across here is the success of the simplicity and meaningful but functional designs of the earlier shoes that lasts. Nike is in danger of losing this quality. So many of the new shoes are cluttered with unnecessary junk. Dear Nike stay genuinely innovative, don't force it! Also bring back designs like the early freeRN flyknits. Simple design at its best. The new freeRN just ain't the same."
755,Everyone out here worshiping the 90 & but always loved the BW's way more!
756,Somebody know what model are the ones appearing in 1932?
757,Airmax one animal pack
758,What’s y’all’s thoughts on the 2090’s tho!?! Cop or Drop?
759,I like them but I think they kind of ruined the OG 90's
760,It’s the AM90 for me…..
761,95s & 98s are for me
762,"Air max 90, 95, 97 are the best classic design under my opinion and WTF is 2090?"

764,stop telling all these stories and release the infrared 90 in 2020 OG form will ya?
765,"I bought my first air max 90 white, and I regretted. Inside of these shoes looks fake. "

769,cool. how much height do they give? they look kinda big
770,"Love the air max 90 Did a nike bye you on the air max 90 I'n black an white ""love them"". Air max is so so comfortable an always look good."

773,97 BY FAR EXEPT I DON'T HAVE A PEAR 
774,Nike please retro the Air Max 360. I beg of you lol.
775,yeah the vapormax sole on the 360 upper doesn't work for me haha. I heard they were going to retro it but had problems with the machines for making the soles. Maybe one day.
776,"553 ""Tinker got a scary post-it on his laptop""  WTF they had laptops in 1987?"
777,Five minutes running video until we can see a picture of God Tinker? What is this? Only him can talk about Air Max. I don´t understand this video without Him.
778,"I don't mind the new Air Maxes, but they don't seem as versatile as the originals. They look like they should only be worn with sportswear imo"
779,My birthday is 26 March  I buy the air max every year
780,Air max 1s though dutch culture )
781,Does anyone know the audio used on this video?
782,"One last comment those Air Max 98 La Mezcla from the Nike by you I think from last year are complete trash, like a Draymond Green jumpshot. That entire pack was trash all those designers took a huge L. You can still find the 98s on sale today"

788,I'v been trying to get 140$ to buy 1 pair of air max for a few months... I'm broke af... feels bad...
789,"we was too busy worrying about getting slapped by the teachers for having a bit too long of a hairstyle back home. we never had no time or money or need to worry about sneakers. Heck nike shoes cost more than our rent. I guess the people in the west had more evolved problems like finding identity, idols, gender etc. Interesting."
790,"The 2090 drawing way too much influence from the ugliest trainers ever conceived. Yes, Yeezys."
791,This is good for Nike Air Max fans but where is the documentary for the Air Force 1's. Please make it happen Nike!!

803,I want those trainers on D.R feet. What are they!
804,Does anyone know what song they used on the Nike air Max 97
805,Unpopular opinion air max 95 is the best looking air max.
806,Soundtrack is on point
807,"Is there a chance that air force 1 gore-Tex boot ""wheat"" will be available here in Sydney Australia?"

811,Air Max 90s over Jordans
812,"Personally, I like Air Maxes and Vapormaxes better than Jordans...And I'm black"
813,"Nike, what happened to the cool 2018 Air Max DLX model? Why are the iconic Air Max’s not performance sneakers  any more??? What’s up with that!? Disappointing! "
814,That model was never really mainstream or iconic like the other pairs featured unfortunately
815,You should have done a section in the video speaking about the Air Max 91 BWAnd by the way the 2090 sucks
816,From Viet Nam with love <3
817,"The vaporfly is boss, if you want a comfy shoe get the vaporfly"
818,Tbh the only kicks I fxck with are air max 90's and I bought 2 pairs of 2090's and they are decent too. Airforce's are also good for a casual look. But apart from those I don't wear any other shoes...
819,"Why not show the Air MAX LTD, FULL Heal Air Pocket, that was revolutionary back in the 90s?????? SMH that LTD silhouette is crazy smooth!"
820,Nike please give more color options for Nike by you air maxes
821,dude the AM 2090 blows. You failed Nike.

833,The roadman shoe
834,714 - 724 what song is that? Sounds dope
835,I love 270s they are stylish and comfy
836,They don't look that good IMO not many people in our generation like those shoes unlike the airmax 90s most people loved them  the 270's aren't gonna be iconic and I wouldn't think people are going to remember them in 30 years time
837,"Tru but they're quite big, a friend of mine wears 270's in a size 9. If I put my vans in next to his nikes it looks like I have midget feet though I wear a size 9 as well "
838,"Rebok Banachey toh Spring Shoe, dunk time Jano brain eh ek tuo Concoction nah hoye , only brain tai ja achey"
839,air max 1 is the best
840,This generation got the Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 LoL
841,These have got Tron all over them.
842,
843,Russian subtitles please!
844,"Take, a hike, Nike! Go woke, go broke. Nike products will never be allowed in my house again."
845,Air max 2090 is trash! They fumbled big time with the opportunity to take this model to new heights.
846,Clark Kent is a corny dude talking about someone else being corny. Hilarious.
847,"Hey got his own shoe line so far from corny, the point he made is true though"

855,Wait where is air max 200? Its not listed on the video.. Thats weird
856,I thought a kid with Cerbral Palsy asked Nike in 2012 to help design a shoe that didn't need hands to put on?  Where is that story or credit?????
857,Air Max 2090 design was okay but why did it have to have long unnatural heels tho. Can’t walk in them properly.
858,Noting fresher than all white air max 90’s

861,i need the air max 90 coral rose pleaaase
862,Please dont buy all the air maxes! Leave me 1 pair
863,24 minutes of Nike whiffing their own farts and telling us it smells like roses.
864,What is the song playing in the background at 1700?
865,"I was about to say, if the gabbers are not in this, it aint right."
866,"Italy not considered except for a little mention to Milan is really disappointing. AM90, AM97 and AMtn (le squalo) here are just religion"

903,@Vlah Blah the Jordan and air max has nothing similar so not the best analogy but the tail wind has the name air max in the name it has all the similar features to Am’s
904,Not a air max but ok. The tailwind had the air max tech but is not a air max. That’s like me saying the air jordans  are my fav air max. They have the same tech but is outside of the air max brand.
905,How about air max excee?

933,342 that shoe is sickk!
934,"airmax 2090 is a completely failed design. need to get out of that line up. And that's where the airmax ‘flyease’ should be in. It is a very revolutionary design, indeed handy shoes. If you try them on, you'll know what I mean."
935,Bring back ripstop
936,I need black/white BW's (((
937,Chill out it's just a shoe
938,they didn't really take off they ruined an icon
939,I don’t even like the 90s like that but u can’t re make something that ain’t broke ie 2090
940,"All that, and the 2090s are ."
941,Air max original .white and silver.

944,"I'm sorry but the 2090's just don't do it for me. Which is a shame cause the 90's are my favorite all time silhouette, PERIOD!"
945,2090 is trash
946,@Vlah Blah I think they just did was airmax 90 and 270 together I think nike is kind of going down to be honest
947,"Fax they said that they made the shoe for youth” but in the video they said an icon isn’t just made the people make the culture, so the 2090 was kinda a failure in that regard.so the design of the 2090 is kinda trash and uninspired IMO cus it’s just a modern 90 AirMax I wish they made it more unique."
948,270's are fire
949,we all know that the three stripes is better
950,1150 tell me what track???
951,"this was a custom gabber track our composer, cyrus melchor, made for the film!"
952,"Airmax makes my feet hurts, cause is not wide enough. If just they make extra wider."
953,buy a half size larger.
954,"Thought this would be what the title says it is, not about randos with an occasional tidbit about the shoe."
955,97 look dope but are bare uncomfy manll stick to the 90s n tns
956,speak English
957,My black thunder 97s got stolen.
958,Is this about Air Max or politics?
959,And the gabbers who go through 10 air max a year bec of the hakken at thunderdome and other gabber partys
960,We all be simpin for the French girl
961,Its nice.
962,Scottie Beam is so fine!
963,"There is so much wrong in this vid let's start by calling out the naming of the '87 as 1, if your being OG it's just the Air Max! And what they hell is up with passing over Walker &amp;  the Max II AKA Light? Nike HATES the Light shoe I reckon as they continually fail to talk about it nor really  promote it as I think they don't see it as revolutionary enough to fit the storyline &amp; has never put the Walker back in production &amp;  Remember how the Light wasn't even included in the History Of Air Pack from a few years back? Big speel on the III's AKA 90's(rightly so)but almost nothing on the 180's. Nike obviously knows the love for the 90 now and promotes the crap out of it but it was'nt the Top Dog for long  before the only real innovation the entire line has seen since '87 was introduced with the 180.  Hardly any mention of the IV AKA Classic AKA BW, this shoe was the REAL UK Air Max, forget the talk on the 90's as that didn't happen until the late 90's &amp; re issues, the IV was massively popular everywhere from the get go! Once again a pass over on the ST &amp; the 270 AKA '93  probably because this shoe is a true spiritual successor to the Light &amp; thus just a footnote* in the history *pun intended*. Nothing on the '94, too light on the '95 given the love thus shoe has. No Racer Max, no '96 not enough depth on the '97 the last passable decent looking Max &amp; popular then &amp; now. Nothing on 98' TL, from memory though that one never really was worn by anyone. Plus' hardly spoke about again despite it's massive popularity.  Deluxe's missed, Tuned Max's? Nothing &amp; this is another  rarity that should be highlighted. '03s? No! Then again that was too golf shoe then &amp;  now. Then a skip to that truly awful 2090, hahahaha! Never thought the 270's &amp; 720's would be topped in the ugly stakes, well done Nike.History not His Story."
964,"@Jamzy I hear ya & I totally agree even though it's a shoe I personally I don't like, if your going to reissue a shoe don't do it half arsed. I skipped a few models simply because it would take me ages to mention them all. One I deliberately missed out was the '01 with the weird tubular Air which was at that point the ugliest shoe I think I ever had seen & one I bet Nike really wished they'd never made."
965,No mention of the air max 360 either. I heard they might retro the 98 TL and if they do it deserves the OG midsole and not for nike to get lazy and slap a 97 sole on like they probably will.
966,how to clean it... i wore it for a week now it is impossible to clean
967,Why 2090 doesn't have React?
968,Look like some addidas.  We all gotta be cool.  Lol. But I got some too.
969,Their ad game is unreal
970,what about the blackman who sent a drawing of a shoe with a visible air bubble that nike refuses to acknowledge????? then gave credit to tinker hatfield!!!!!

988,I don't care nike history. Adidas it's the best
989,"shame the air unit is not larger, its shrunk over the years especially the air max 90's and bw classics, you used be able look through the window and see more columns now its just tiny ,same with the 180's the whole trainer has changed in shape and air unit size...nike just dont do it no more yet the prices increase!! Sad but true!!"
990,@Leotseddap but the quality is not at it anymore and the price just keeps increasing
991,"@Leotseddap I'm on about the ones from 1990 and 1991, they were alot bigger, they had to change the design of the air unit in 2003 due to climate change, and they had to change the gas that filled the air unit hence why the original moulds had to be changed look up original 1991 air max on google and you'll see the difference, even the 180's air unit and overall shape has changed, been wearing air maxes since I was 12 im in my 40's now, so i know and seen the changes, hope that helps "
992,look at the newer 2090's or 270's
993,I just compared my OG Classic/BW with the ones I bought in 2017 due to your post but.... there is no difference.
994,“Idk if this new generation has a shoe for them”... umm Yeezys 
995,I got the all white 2090's.  I just do not think they are on Air Max 90s level.

1067," It is the worst shoe and the stupidest idea for shoes on the face of the earth .. Because I bought several Air Max shoes a few years ago, and when I went and friends on the way to the cinema, I mistook on a nail that was lying on the floor and suddenly the air was emptied from the inside of the shoe and I became walking, limping, and my shape became embarrassing in the street .. Since that day I have been sharing all of my acquaintances and friends  and social media with this disastrous experience with this stupid shoe so that a small nail in the street makes it useless."

There just very passionate about the thing they like so why do you have to criticize that. People might have nostalgia or it might be some type of accomplishment to get the shoe they finally wanted. People who like shoes just might want them because how it looks . People are going to have passion about things like food, art, clothing, anime, cars.

1110,@Ultron didn't know boy scouts was considered a sport. Thx for your input.
1111,@alek madrid Matter of fact.. Idk why I even replied or jus tried to explain myself ! This is old & I'm bored w/ it sooo have a good rest of your day/life !!
1112,"@alek madrid I have literally deleted zero posts..  Must've caught a glimpse of someone else's comment bc all I said initially was ""Bro wtfrick"" sooo ain't nobody back peddling mate ."
1113,@J A B must be that post you deleted...... back peddling  I see
1114,@J A B they can try if they want but never make it to the elite level. They don’t have nearly as much testosterone and natural muscle.
1115,"@Luke Whelan Nothing more, nothing less.. I didn't ask to be further educated about why men playing Female sports w/ women would dominate."
1116,@Luke Whelan I mean I see wym.. But what I asked was could a woman who transitioned not play male sports ?
1117,@alek madrid I'm curious as to where you read tht I was implying that @ all..
1118,@J A B no you don’t get it woman don’t compete at the same level as men so women playing with men won’t have as much success and men playing with woman will dominate
1119,@J A B lol just curious but what sports are you implying woman are better in? Bc I don't see any at a professional lvl anywhere
1120,"@Embrace Masculinity Has nothing to do w/ ""living in a bubble"".."
1121,@Embrace Masculinity It works both ways no? If a woman transitioned could they not do male sports or is tht not a thing?? Honestly asking.
1122,@J A B Are you unaware that men can now pretend to be women? Or do you live in a bubble?
1123,Bro wtfrick??
1124,"Hell yeah. They want equality, we’ll give them equality"

1142,He also kneeled while obama was President. 3 yrs before Trump won.
1143,@Mr. Nyce Guy what do you mean? You people?
1144,@Dementia Joe smokes Newports what do you mean? You people?..
1145,@Mr. Nyce Guy watch it now mr. racist guy
1146,I can’t argue
1147,@Mr. Nyce Guy Patriotism isn't rocket science. It's a love of country. Clearly you don't. But next time try to stay away from the non-sequiturs okay? People might think you're not too bright.
1148,@Mr. Nyce Guy What is this imaginary “establishment” you people keep talking about?
1149,@Mr. Nyce Guy Nobody is scared of people who kneel. That just confirms submission. Remedial-level symbology.
1150,He kneeled as a sign of submission because thats what kneeling is

1161,The same people who beg for protection every five minutes is also being pandered to by every Fortune 500 company in America.Something isn’t making sense here.
1162,@J. O. nice job putting words in people’s mouths. Typical SJW tactic
1163,Am I mistaken or is the base of your comment that Black Women don't deserve to be protected?
1164,@Mr. Nyce Guy facts but they'll learn the hard way in the end
1165,@Greg A Don't bring that Kool Aid to a grown man's party.
1166,Please explain to me more how the people who own those Fortune 500 companies are the ones facing “real” oppression.
1167,"Greg A they're still at it, Antifa/BLM has been marching on live TV the last 12 months. The ""neo Nazis"" are still at it as is..."
1168,Could be cops murdering unarmed people in the streets. Or the Neo Nazis who marched on live TV a few years back
1169,I stopped buying this brand a while back.  Always nice to have affirmation of the right choice.
1170,You know what the saddest part is the reason companies make commercials like this is because they know that there are people who are going to fall for it.

1180,@fog doctors when black women give birth
1181,@via shaw lol.... if we gonna play that game let’s talk about the average amount of white people dying per day.
1182,"@J A B blm is responsible for over 20 deaths during the george floyd riots, and that includes unarmed blacks"
1183,"@Sleepy yeah and 75% of immigrants vote democrat. The only reason states turn blue is because blacks, Asians and hispanics flood cities like Chicago and Miami, and then voting districts are gerrymandered to help democrats."
1184,"@dev george floyd, rayshard brooks, michael brown, mlk jr., and all the other alliterations had criminal records and were committing crimes when they got quickscoped by police. You smug stoggaf say that educated people are leftist, but you always leave out those facts."
1185,@puwa. Exactly.
1186,@Fallen Ghost And what about all the strong Black leaders in History tht practiced peaceful protests & yet were still unjustly murdered? Mlk ring a bell? So many yrs of trying to do things the right way & still such little change..
1187,"@Fallen Ghost Umm no that's where you're wrong.. So bc tht also happened you're going to just overlook those who peacefully protested, who were actually fighting to make a difference? No they shouldn't go unnoticed, but ppl are so quick to focus on the negative nowadays tht they forget the positive. Also as some already stated some ppl used tht as an opportunity to loot. However some who did the burning were INDEED BLM members, but ppl all grieve and express anger differently am I justifying what they did no, but to be suppressed & pushed against for yrs n after all this time to be right back @ what seems to be square 1... Tht was the straw tht broke the camel's back for some. Enough had been enough.."
1188,"@cyberbutterfly K, but who's doing the killing?"
1189,"@dev Okay, and when black people have a different view on this, what do you call it?"
1190,"@Fallen Ghost yea i dont believe the people who did that were ""Blm"" they couldve been people using blm as an excuse to commit crimes"
1191,@dev white privilege doesn't exist and yeah good job naming 4 examples the evil media chose to highlight. You are ignorant to how many people die each day. I bet you think all this c o v stuff is real and I'm sure you wear a muzzle too.
1192,@dev who's getting murdered for that? Site your sources 
1193,@via shaw white people are killed and over 2x the rate. Sit down with your victim mentality.
1194,"@J A B burning down innocent people’s businesses, including black owned businesses, attacking and beating people over a political difference, causing domestic terrorism yet have the audacity to call it peaceful?? BLm is a Marxist domestic terrorist organization that pretends to only care about lifelong criminals because of a skin color."
1195,"@dev Had overdosed on heroin, but he also had a criminal record over his lifetime. Doesn't mean he deserves to die, but his lifestyle choice led to his untimely death.  Also, those police that use such force are almost always from Democratic cities and states. Think about that for a little bit."
1196,"@Fallen Ghost Don't try to take a positive movement and it turn into another sick, twisted narrative!"
1197,"@matthew price more white people are dying because there are more white people here in the U.S. Black folks are dying at a higher rate. We SHOULD be focused on fixing the problem, not fighting with each other."
1198,"@via shaw being murdered by your own yes. But you don’t care about that do you?? Only when it’s a white cop regardless of it was justified or not. BLM= Burn, Loot, Murder"
1199,"@dev Minority? Give me a break, white men only make up 4% of the world's population. They are the minority, not you. Get over yourself."
1200,"@bo gard hey, don't treat black women like a monolith. That's what the SJWs want."
1201,"@Heaven Goebel because No Name stating the obvious is ""racism"" according to you lefty crazies."
1202,@via shaw your not stfu.
1203,wow the racism really jumped out with this comment  no shame whatsoever
1204,@via shaw citation needed.
1205,"@dev Yeah, lots of racists marry people of a different race...good call."
1206,"@via shaw yeah, by other black people and planned parenthood."
1207,"@agrendae it’s not about being equally, because no other race/gender combination has nationally coordinated advertising campaigns, educational courses, and media packages dedicated to telling them just how wonderful you are. When’s the last “White Men are Amazing!” campaign you’ve seen from Disney+?"
1208,"@dev You've obviously never had to take into custody someone that was 6'6 230lbs w/ lethal dose(s) of m3th in his system. The cop who did it, his wife was of Asian descent...cry racism more."
1209,@Galaxy so are the majority of ppl in poor areas in Republican states yet they don't get killed?
1210,Based
1211,@matthew price because y'all actually attack and kill cops
1212,@matthew price black women are killed at a higher rate then any other women
1213,@via shaw you mean blacks? Yes by other blacks.
1214,"@dev you aren’t either, so shut up and quit the fake victimhood"
1215,"@PraiseTheAlmightyGod What we NEED is 4 ppl like you to be out of our judicial system, police forces, etc... until you finally open your eyes to the REAL issues n not the biased picture you wanna paint or narratives you wanna hear.. The only thing tht ppl NEED is equality which seems more like never as time goes on !"
1216,@PraiseTheAlmightyGod Bro why do you keep replying to my comments yet you said not to reply to yoooouu???!
1217,"@matthew price have you not payed attention at all in the last year to George Floyd, Brayla Stones, etc.? It’s pretty obvious  if you don’t get it your white privilege is clearly getting the best of you"
1218,It’s not about being “special”. It’s about being respected as equal.
1219,"@dev you’re not getting killed bc of any of those fam ,name one person who got killed bc of any of those."
1220,@matthew price are y’all getting murdered because of your skin color/gender/sexuality? I don’t think so
1221,@via shaw who is we? White people are dying at a higher rate than everyone else bc we make up most of America 
1222,Not you ignoring the fact that we are constantly being murdered
1223,"@J A B Yes, needing."
1224,"Just play, don’t get played. don’t care which color you be, be nice and kind & teach your children well"
1225,That crystal dunn goal was awesome 
1226,Woah! Great video Nike! I want to know more about how you make such great products! You must be a great company to work for!Perhaps I can tour a manufacturing facility? I'm sure your employees will also sing your praises!
1227,https//youtu.be/aMX5FEjJ1SM
1228,"@UnknownFor Whaaaat? How could such a progressive company exploit people like that, while simultaneously calling for social equity?! "
1229,"Yeah. They will. Its not like they're underpaid children making shoes for $1.25 an hour...(or per shoe, depends on what Chinese sweatshop they are working in...)"
1230,How real are they going to be able to play when men are absolutely dominating every woman sport they compete in? Also pay those Chinese indentured servants in your Nike factories a living wage.
1231,"But.. men don't compete in women's sports. Well, of course, trans men compete in women's sports, cause people make zero sense."
1232,@Godwin Ejacha Stop spamming
1233,"@cursorguy ""Retirement"" good luck with that. Retirement is puttering around your tiny home or assisted living facility on a few hundred dollars a month completely zonked on pain meds and dementia while Indian guys on the phone and sweepstakes companies scam you out of what little money you have left"
1234,@Interdimensional Fox lol ok I guess you never heard of retirement?
1235,Indentured servants got the property and money outright after 7 years of labor. I want to be one. America makes you work until you die.
1236,Preach!
1237,I REALLY like this commercial. 
1238,The type of content I want to see! Let's play real Nike!!!
1239,Victimhood is a powerful aphrodisiac.
1240,"Exactly.  ""People of color"" say all white people are racist the day they are born and we should feel guilty about our skin collor. Then they say black people cant be racist.  to defend themselves.  Joe biden is about to sign orders to pay blacks reparations from only the white americans pocket."
1241,That's one of the most blatantly racist things I've seen in a while.WOKEISBROKE!
1242,"“It’s okay consumer, we are not just a soulless, malicious brand, look at how progressive we’re being!”"
1243,"Nike, i love that you’re all about empowering marginalized communities! How about you start by paying your Chinese sweatshop workers more than 1.00 USD a day! Your products take advantage of impoverished countries and their citizens in order to get cheap labor with no unionization. Your pseudo-virtue signaling is shallow and further explains why people are moving away from your products."
1244,"At the prices they charge for mire  stitched cloth and leather, do you think they would be able to afford to pay them more than a dollar a day."
1245,Isn’t the league dominated by black Women or am I missing the point?
1246,@Greg A Jesse Smolett should be their spokesperson.   Fit right in !!
1247,@Greg A it’s really nothing more than anti-logic
1248,"I think they meant socially. It’s Anti-racism, anti-misogynist"
1249,Level the playing field give someone something for free. 
1250,Give a black womxn your laptop. Nike said that would help!
1251,"""Just do it"" is a Chinese sweat shop slogan too"
1252,"@Michael Munoz Okay, that really didn’t have much to do with what I said."
1253,@KidKashi i dont buy Nike's. End to your story
1254,@Michael Munoz yes it is but if you are going to do all that then you can’t be out here criticizing Nike. Buy whatever you want but you can’t be buying these things and then complain about a company using the same labor that got you those items.
1255,@KidKashi you said in a earlier comment that im no better for supporting the industry.. When i buy shoes for a child who has no shoes is that immoral? When the homeless ask me for food i will give it to him. When some who doesn't have a coat and is cold outside wouldn't you give it to them? Do you think the ppl who have not ask where it is made? Who picked the food? Or why wasn't this made in America? Im good at only a few things but i will give my time and talents for free knowing that I store treasure in heaven. Not because i want treasure but because there is a God and He can change immorality to moral. Sickness to health.
1256,@Michael Munoz is that a quote or a metaphor for something?
1257,"@KidKashi i believe if someone has no shoes, give them a pair. If someone ask for food, give them food. If someone needs a coat, give them a coat. I challenge you to do the same.  You'll never know.. you might be entertaining angels."
1258,@Michael Munoz yeah I hate when YT does that
1259,@KidKashi my real thoughts of nike utube erased three times. Im surprised that went threw. Lol
1260,"@Michael Munoz yep, so your supporting those industries, so don’t act like you’re helping by making fun of Nike when you aren’t doing any better."
1261,@KidKashi if i had two cups connected with string in the middle.. It still would be made in another country
1262,@KidKashi How do yoh kniw hes using an Ipod? Could be using one plus or something similar
1263,Your device that you typed this on was made in the exact same way
1264,@No Name3 thats how my own family talks and my wife is black
1265,Average hating Hispancs
1266,Damn. I feel like an asshole laughing at your comment lol.
1267,Just do it or get disappeared 
1268,Wow. Look at all that diversity.
1269,Great commercial 
1270,Maybe people will watch the WNBA when men play in it.
1271,They're already playing now. Wait... You mean to tell me those were women the whole time????
1272,"I'm throwing away my Nike T-shirt now. Thanks, guys!"
1273,Support a level playing field for black woman in sports by allowing men to compete in women’s sports.
1274,Most people are rarely recognized for the hard work they put in. Victory!
1275,I Love it! 
1276,Nike we support human right Meanwhile kids in poor countries
1277,"@Godwin Ejacha I agree with you.But they do these types of ads only to make them self’s look like a good company,but in reality they really don’t care about human right but just profit."
1278,@Godwin Ejacha Nike abuses poor kids in Work factories...
1279,“Get woke go broke”-anybody with an iq over 10
1280,Which is unfortunately only a minority of the population considering how they managed to get a geriatric patient in power.
1281,"It's easy to tell when someone directing a commercial like this says ""Just fill it with black people, not very many white people, that'll make us look good"" You're not doing it to recognize black athletes, you're doing it to win brownie points... No pun intended."
1282,How about stop making money off of child slavery?
1283,@Godwin Ejacha They must not teach logic in Cameroon
1284,"@Godwin Ejacha And your recycled point is? I am not the one who is virtue signalling, do you comprehend the difference? Like if you say meat is murder, then eat meat, you're a hypocrite. If you don't say that and eat meat, you're not a hypocrite"
1285,What do you mean child slavery ??????? I’m confused
1286,@Anna meow How? I’m just pointing out the hypocrisies.
1287,"@natashka1982 you literally said, “only an idiot would by a 80$ hoodie made by child labor”. Either way you still support those industries so you are virtue signaling as well."
1288,"@KidKashi I'm not chastising others for buying Nike, I'm chastising Nike for virtue signalling"
1289,@natashka1982 but you’re literally out here complaining that Nike uses that type of labor saying you don’t but Nike when you’re no better than Nike because of the multiple items that you own that come from China. Don’t clown others for buying Nike when I’m sure you have devices that come from the same place.
1290,@KidKashi Again... I'm not preaching about equality like Nike does.
1291,"@natashka1982 Half the stuff you buy daily is from China, so don’t blame Nike when you yourself is supporting the slave labor."
1292,@Mikey MGTOW well I’m 99.9% sure something you own has.
1293,@Scorpius Jones I'm not the one virtue signalling about fairness and equality the way Nike does.
1294,"You use a smart phone, right?"
1295,"@Christy Louis You're assuming that everyone wears shitty sportswear. I have a Nike hoodie that I bought at Goodwill, so zero of my money goes to Chinese sweatshops. Only an idiot would spend $80 on a shirt made by children in slave camps."
1296,But you’re still gonna wear Nike tho 
1297,"@Hama Brewer ohh okay I see. Are a large amount of ppl just now finding out about this? Bc this has gone on for the longest, so I’m surprised this is my first time seeing one of their ads spammed like this."
1298,Was the device to you typed this on not made in the same place? In the exact same way?
1299,@Suryi Stewart because Nike acting like a moral advocate by making this video absolutely disgraced human rights and all morality by operating the sweatshops. It’s hypocritical.
1300,"I’m not trying to discredit anything, but what does that have to do with this video? And why was this video such a trigger for that response? That could’ve been put to better use elsewhere, like an actual campaign for the cause."
1301,@Commie clowns bruhhhh
1302,@ItzMari straight fax
1303,@Cooper Young fax
1304,They only care when it’s bout them
1305,Because slavery is only bad if it's done to black female American athletes.
1306,Reading the comments give me back my faith in humanity!!!...thank you everyone!!!
1307,One of the best commercial i ever seeen in my 30 years of living
1308,@Big Balls whose pitying black people what are you talking about
1309,@chukieri ! Because Nike is synonymous with China who are currently operating concentration camps and committing human rights abuses as we speak.So F Nike and their products which are made by slaves and children.
1310,@chukieri ! why not tf?
1311,why?
1312,"Make it level add trans men in it, that will make it level!"
1313,@Godwin Ejacha They’ll care once they start losing their customers
1314,@Chill Okapi exactly this is insane!
1315,Once fringe D 1 men start identifying as women.... that’ll be it for “woman’s” basketball
1316,Enough already we the people are tired of this!!!!
1317,@ryan k they are finally waking
1318,Love this commercial.... Thank you Nike
1319,The playing field was always even. Some groups of people just trained harder than others.
1320,We are a Nike Fam FOR SURE!!!!
1321,Enough said!
1322,I'M BEING OPPRESSED billion dollar companies give you all the attention and support you want
1323,@cyberbutterfly can’t win an argument? Just jump to “suPremaCist”
1324,"@cyberbutterfly *You're a troll.Please stop putting literally into sentences when it doesn't belong there grammatically. As for your use of the word &quot;your&quot;, you used the incorrect spelling variation of it's accurate counterpart &quot;you're&quot;, as in &quot;You're a big idiot.&quot; or &quot;You're a low life stereotypical twitter user who has to get mad over anything because you haven't learned to mature despite your age reflecting the opposite, as if you're in a constant state of regression.&quot; Please refrain from any conversation until you have learned to correctly string a sentence together you dimwitted nincompoop."
1325,@Lockstep Chris your literally a troll
1326,@Lockstep Chris OK supremacist
1327,"@J A B In this modern day and age, anyone can be anything as oppression is thrown around every sentence made by any individual. Are you assuming that I am not a woman or black? I am gender liquid. When frozen I am a male, but melted I am a female. As for black, my great, great, great, great, great, great ancestor was a form of black. I took a DNA test and found that I am 0.05% black. So I have the right to say what I can."
1328,"@cyberbutterfly I couldn't help but notice how poor your grammar is. I can tell that you got so mad that you spelled ""your"" wrong in the context of the sentence you are using it it. The correct way to use it is ""you're"", as in ""you are."""
1329,@Tora Chan The comment is literally about blk ppl she has every right to be concerned by it..
1330,@cyberbutterfly mad about what? The only thing I'm mad about is the fact the adult swim app won't let me view sealab 2021 for free unless I connect a cable plan to it.
1331,"@cyberbutterfly you’re the mad one, coming to a comment that doesn’t concern you"
1332,Sounds like your mad asf
1333,Looks like people are finally waking up to corporate wokeness.

1336,"&quot;My finger is broken, I don't think I can finish my quota of making 500 pairs of shoes today.&quot;(Boss looks up, smiles and says)&quot;Just do it.&quot;"
1337,wowwwww so inspiring...
1338,Based on what I just saw seems like most of the world is on your side.
1339,Is the field not level? Virtue signaling at its finest.
1340,So lack of diversity is good so long as it benefits a certain group.
1341,@TETRA as he should
1342,"Exactly.  ""People of color"" say all white people are racist the day they are born and we should feel guilty about our skin collor.

1343,Your products are made in literal sweatshops
1344,Minnie Riperton- “Les Fleurs” is the song
1345,"@Lars Frederiksen I appreciate the gratitude lol. Not that you need to hear the story, but, It was driving me nuts that I knew this song but didn’t know the title but knew I’d heard it somewhere. I scrolled through all these comments and couldn’t find anything, just a bunch of race based comments.Not that you need to know the story, but, long story short I finally found this app (Google assistant) where you hum the song. You say, “Hey Google” what’s this song. Then I hummed the melody and it showed up. From there, I read the comments of this song and found out where I’d heard it. It’s played at the end/outro of the movie “Us.”Then the last thing I did was post the title of the song because I’d be a dick if I didn’t help someone not drive themselves insane trying to find this song."
1346,Thank you for your service. Had to look through a lot of unhappy comments to find this haha
1347,So all men play fake? That's why you have to have your own league. It just facts.
1348,NIKE is so good I recommend it
1349,I respekt wahmens. Please give me attention because I respekt all wahmens so much.
1350,@TehUltimateSnake oops I must have-[redacted]
1351,@UnknownFor Nike You’re not supposed to mention that
1352,umm sir do you respect genocidal maniacs in China as well? Mr Nike what is your comment on that?
1353,I too love dishwashers
1354,Never forget that for years the nba has put money into the WNBA just to keep it alive 
1355,You mean since inception.
1356,Great commercial
1357,I'd rather wear wooden planks on my feet than support this crap.
1358,I know that’s a lie lol
1359,why?
1360,Nike never give asian people credit for anything.
1361,"@# cooliki do some research before you speak. Because right now, you are in a place of pure ignorance"
1362,@Sleepy Who tf uses coloreds to describe black people in 2021?
1363,"@bo gard ""Black people"", they are so important to you that you abbreviate their race as if they are a product....how progressive of you."
1364,@# cooliki Nobody even watches the WNBA
1365,"@Interdimensional Fox who tf told you that? That's not what i call ""facts""."
1366,@Yasa is here Black women can't beat a 12 year old white boy. Facts.
1367,"@Sleepy that i agree on, black people are always used for marketting and its worse for the asian people making the products"
1368,"@Sleepy Good point, actually. The democrats are only digging colored people into a bigger hole that they can’t get out of so that they continue to vote for them for more free stuff."
1369,@bo gard wtf are you talking about? There are tons of black people in the NBA because a lot of black people like basketball
1370,"I mean money is their main motive, they’re doing this to seem politically correct."
1371,@Wardo Church Fan lmao you think the NBA just drafts anyone that's blk or they draft the best players in the world? I wonder why Luka Doncic got drafted then?
1372,I don’t understand how Asians can support the democrats at this point. Like liberals pretty much hate Asians just as much as they hate whites.
1373,"@Mason the fisherman Augustine why don't you leave and go back to wherever you're from? Blk ppl have been here since the beginning, the first person to die for America was a blk man, Crispus Attucks"
1374,"@# cooliki That is not true. I can tell you that black women ARE GREAT at sports that is why they DOMINATE! Do you know how hard they had to work just to get credit for doing 2 times what other white athletes did? They don't get free credit, and these are just facts!"
1375,@bo gard black people tons of praise. Just look at the NBA
1376,@bo gard then leave American if it’s so bad
1377,"They didn't give blacks credit for anything either, Until they started winning in the Olympics, and other elite level athletic sporting events."
1378,Because you're white.
1379,Even when they work tirelessly to make their shoes and shirts
1380,what do you plan on doing about it give representation to your own people fight for more diversity
1381,Because people from china are making those LeBron shoes getting payed 10 cents an hour
1382,Nike wants to empower black womenAlso Nike executives   
1383,"My oh my, it’s some bitter folks in these comments! Why don’t you all save that energy and quit being so petty. The ad was absolutely amazing and true!!!"
1384,I wonder how inspirational this is to the Uyghur woman?
1385,Man then Muslim women must be so proud
1386,"“Level the playing field for black women.”What, you mean like affirmative action?"
1387,Don’t black women already do a lot of sports? I don’t see any problem here besides the fact that this ad is creating a wider gap between races.You are LITERALLY showing people playing sports and having fun. Why do you have to bring history up??
1388,"Exactly.  ""People of color"" say all white people are racist the day they are born and we should feel guilty about our skin collor. Then they say black people cant be racist.  to defend themselves.  Joe biden is about to sign orders to pay blacks reparations from only the white americans pocket."
1389,"You might try something new. Like completing a sentence. We play FOR real. Yeah, it’s tricky."
1390,You guys still pay your workers in China Penny an hour?
1391,"@Scorpius Jones  it is, it so high in fact that I can see all the land can offer. Walmart just sells suicided prevention nets, Nike actively puts them around their factories in Asia because they pay them so little. Ill grant you neither is a good thing, but what you said isn't equivocal. Also, I don't shop at Wal-Mart"
1392,"@Mikey MGTOW I know but most products are, if it’s clothes, shoes, technology, etc its most likely made in China. Most items found at Walmart are from China. That’s where the U.S gets a lot of things so don’t only blame Nike, you can’t be the one talking if you buy the products as well."
1393,@KidKashi Not everything was made in China tard.
1394,"You still shop at Walmart, right? Nice high horse you got there."
1395,"Don't be silly, it's a penny a day."
1396,@Zeusthe_kingg Well I’m sure the some parts came from China too. But if not your device then something in your house is.
1397,The device you typed this on was made in the exact same way and from the exact same place. And I’m sure many other things you own do too.
1398,"This day and age, workers are lucky to not get harvested for slacking.Nike &quot;I'll allow you live and continue being my slave as payment from now on&quot;"
1399,This is why I buy Under Armour
1400,Yu actually wear dat!? 
1401,It needs to be leveled for them 
1402,i almost liked until i remembered the sweat shops with children.
1403,I actually watched a google commercial on my tv about women’s day and they were showing Sally Ride as the first woman in space but in reality Sally Ride was only the first American woman in space. The actual first woman in space was Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova who flew to space 20 years before Sally Ride. That really made me confused about googles knowledge of history.
1404,“Level the playing field” by now allowing men to play against women. Murica.
1405,"EVERYBODY WALKING ON 2 FEET IS CONSIDERED MY BROTHER OR SISTER. Don’t let these companies divide us citizens apart. That’s what they’re trying to do. If you’re alive today, You’re worthy. Not because your skin tone, but because you are here, alive, and full of love, life, laughter, hate, sadness and anger. They can’t bring us down if we act as one."
1406,When corporations fund your “revolutionary” movement it’s not revolutionary.
1407,"If they weren’t so obsessed with past slavery, they might have to contend with present slavery. But they’d rather not, because this way they can pretend to be morally superior without ever actually doing *anything at all*."
1408,I wouldn’t be caught dead in anything Nike.
1409,You know by consistently trying to shove this crap down peoples throats... is just gonna make them reject it even more?
1410,The kids working at your sweatshops give you their blood sweat and tears too.
1411,Hypocritical and narcissistic SHOE company sells over priced low quality products
1412,Happy Irish-American History month!
1413,Y’all go I’m so proud of who I am even though I’m a black young men I understand that without women we wouldn’t be anything we’re dependent of eachother
1414,"Honestly, completely agree with the message, but I don't like how they want me to accept that a woman smashing a tennis racket into the ground can be acceptable. It is disrespectful to the game and both men and women suffer the same consequences for it."
1415,"&quot;It's not magic, it's organic&quot;*wears make up, eye lash stuff, hide realism, pretty much exist as not organic"
1416,Any of these woke sports is not for me my brain is based in reality not stupidity
1417,@Godwin Ejacha What’s up with left wingers and assuming we watch Fox News? Nobody watches that
1418,@Godwin Ejacha I have also lost hope in humanity because the phony news is trying to drive a wedge between whites and blacks.
1419,@Godwin Ejacha has nothing to do with being good at sports and everything about being out of step with the rest of the world and reality
1420, #iSERGthat #BlackGirlMagic is REAL
1421,@Stratejic #Periodt 
1422,“We can make something appear out of absolutely nothing” - exactly. “Racism.”
1423,30 seconds and my comment on Asian slavery was deleted.
1424,You already know Nike is the King of virtue signaling
1425,@Mike Smith yeah what they are doing is sick and they need help
1426,@J. O. Nike products are produced in dangerous environments under inhuman conditions. Mostly in Asian countries. Nike refuses to sign the Bangladesh Fire and Safety agreement.  NIKE should never be celebrated nor should any person who wears it's products.  Including these hypocritical women.
1427,"Mind me asking, why you would post something about Asian Slavery on a post celebrating Black Women?Admittedly, I didn't see your post but what does that topic have to do with this video? <a href=""http//www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23genuinequestion"">#GenuineQuestion</a>"
1428,@Armed Disks Nike literally makes its shitty shoes in Africa as well but I guess you dont care..White people are majority the CEO's of these woke companies making these commercials and using this rhetoric but you're not going to talk about that.
1429,What a Shame YouTube...
1430,Sweatshop products
1431,You exploit people and then expect us to congratulate you?
1432,Never forget that those kids making your shoes in harsh sweat shops lives matter!
1433,If this is woke im going back to bed
1434,@Godwin Ejacha 1. No iPhone stop assuming 2. I didn't go out of way to attack Nike. They are the ones trying to convince us that they are somehow decent people (This is an ad remember)3. You believe them because your love of black people is more important than what negatives they might be doing to another group of people. Now you're projecting that here and making yourself look silly in the process.
1435,@Godwin Ejacha please don't actually do research on the company then. Wouldn't want to pop that little bubble.
1436,What do you mean by woke? I missed that part of the video tbh. I took it a whole different way I think
1437,"“Goodnight, girl, I’ll see you tomorrow”"
1438,Is there 1 good comment here? Give this a  if you still Nike needs to do more.
1439,You think shoes just make themselves? Nah baby.... you need a sweatshop for that
1440,Na this ain't no magic this is the real
1441,This must be real inspirational to those Chinese kids in the sweatshops that you run.
1442,Remember the days when we judged people based off their character and not their skin color? Those were pretty nice
1443,“Level the playing field” yet they show a biological man running against biological women. I can’t stop laughing. Caught this commercial lighting the bbq with charcoal all over my hands. I never watch commercials but this one I had to look up. Too funny
1444,"I've seen a trans man actively compete in women's sports because of people like you, you make no god damn sense."
1445,I watch many athletes going from collage to becoming millionaires over night only to be broke when its over.  How about setting up financial councling and money management  skills. Were not stupid. We see right through you.
1446,That one man on the track was blowing everybody away
1447,"For the Asian, middle eastern, hispanic,  white and all the other races that will never get recognized.  We love you too even when the media and society will say you don't matter."
1448,This video has more views than all of last seasons WNBA games combined.
1449,Biden just changed all that.
1450,@Embrace Masculinity Those were the days...
1451,God what an awful president. I miss Trump.
1452,You're right! Hahahahahahahaha! Nothing to see here. Move along...
1453,We play real? What kind of English is that?
1454,"@Interdimensional Fox Don't call them dumb, it’s insulting! ...to dumb people"
1455,@Interdimensional Fox no that’s literally how we talk it’s aave
1456,@Joe Blow um what?
1457,"@Mr. Nyce Guy careful talking about inbred.....youd be surprised America is the least inbred nation, and you don't want to know how bad 3rd world counties are."
1458,It’s not. Lol
1459,They think black women are dumb that's why.
1460,"Taken in a different context it fits better. If you say ""we 'play' real"" as in ""we pretend to be real"" it makes more sense and is more grammatically (and realistically) accurate."
1461,They are  thinking it's black womens English.  Insulting and condencending
1462,@grey. bruh what u spelled it wrong
1463,English that was approved by the Chinese communist party
1464,Ebinics. Low iq
1465,"April 25, 2021 - I never realized gymnast Simone Biles was signed with #Nike. Clearly she is NOT is this Nike ad or any Nike ad that I recall. It is no wonder Simone left Nike for the Gap brand #Athleta"
1466,“We play real” yeah real bad 
1467,@Bigg Facts probably because of the Chinese sweatshops but potato patato every company's doing it nowadays
1468,More successful than anyone you know
1469,What’s gross
1470,Yall are magic now really way to go america the real thing ha
1471,Yo @Nike whens the Nike 2022 gonna be in production?
1472,Why dont yall Acknowledge The men the same?
1473,@TETRA when did you get that?
1474,"and i say ""people of color"" because I was told I AM RACIST because I called someone black..."
1475,"@Embrace Masculinity Exactly.  ""People of color"" say all white people are racist the day they are born and we should feel guilty about our skin collor. Then they say black people cant be racist.  to defend themselves.  Joe biden is about to sign orders to pay blacks reparations from only the white americans pocket."
1476,We need more Asain in the NFL and Mexicans in the NBA.
1477,@Embrace Masculinity sadly true
1478,Because it’s considered ok to be sexist towards men and racist towards whites nowadays
1479,Level the playing field for white and latina players.
1480,Come on! We can do better
1481,@Lovely Leen Nice strawman 
1482,@Lovely Leen which noodles there's plenty of instant ramen companies
1483,"A lot of popular foods has aborted baby cells in them like Nestlé, Pepsi company, Kraft/Cadberry, the companies of Lays chips, Ruffles, Instant Noodles and plenty more. How's that for not spending money on big corporations?? "
1484,At this point I literally can’t buy anything from big corporations because they are all propaganda warehouses.
1485,034 I recognized my old high school right away.
1486,"I came for the like to dislike ratio & comments. Can't say I'm unimpressed, as I am indeed impressed"
1487,Yeah I’d rather watch legit anything else then watching them Lazily walk up and down the court to do nothing
1488,Aren’t black women the best athletes across most sports though?
1489,Every major accomplishment those women make have already been done my men whats the big deal with women sports anyway.
1490,Them chineses make damn good shoes
1491,"They can make things appear from nothing?! So you’re claiming to be God then? I’m all for equality amongst all people, but not equality with God. This is just nonsense."
1492,"""NIKE we own people, like actual slaves"""
1493,"Sports, athletes are idolized. Bread and Circuses"
1494,How about the moms and dads that have to work in your sweatshops? Smh when you gonna focus on real problems
1495,The 1000+ people that liked this have probably said they would fight against slavery if they were alive for it.  But are doing exactly the opposite right now 
1496,Virtue signal to the max
1497,"It's really strange to read an ad saying, ""level the playing field for black women"" while clips of competing basketball teams composed of entirely black women play in the background. There's no problem with the teams, it just becomes a bit nonsensical when reading the headline of the video."
1498,But we are progressive can you see?
1499,Nike maybe put some of the millions of dollars you got of one pair of shoes into making a better place for people to work.
1500,"I'm pretty sure top athletes get all the recognition, no matter the race, gender, religion, etc. Especially tennis, where women get paid the same as men, yet they don't have to play as long of a match as men in the grand slams."
1501,Month number two?   We’re in March!
1502,@ACE CLOP no non binary people are the gender they where born with
1503,"@Glo I agree trans men are men, trans women are women and non binary people aren't either"
1504,@ACE CLOP Stop the Cap Men are Men women are women nothing will ever change that
1505,"Lmao ""how dare they make 1 commercial celebrating blk women immediately after blk history month, now back to my all white commercials"""
1506,@Bill Kekler I'm pretty sure this is advanced biology we're talking about but studies show that trans people have brains that are closer to the gender they identify as
1507,"@ACE CLOP I took biology class in high school and know historically they are the same thing. I have not seen a single shred of real science that supports trans people, but I have seen more than enough to disprove them. I will not bend the knee to liberal social engineering and propaganda."
1508,@Bill Kekler I think you're thinking of &quot; Sex &quot;With gender it's largely social and science actually supports trans people )
1509,@ACE CLOP No they are not. When your bones are dug up they either address you as a male or female. That is determined by your chromosomes. You can't change that or be anything else. Just follow the science.
1510,Black history is all year but mostly in February but it’s all year so you mad and it’s womens month but it doesn’t even matter so shut up
1511,"@Bill Kekler They are, I think it's also good that they're addressing homophobia and transphobia in the African American community because it's a serious problem that no one talks about"
1512,@ACE CLOP Trans women are not women. 032
1513,I think March is actually women's history Month )
1514,So what?
1515,"it looks like those empty seats might be filling up soon so people can watch that whole"" equality"" act unfold nicely..."
1516,I can just for the comments..... and I'm very satisfied 
1517,1st track runner no woman no cry!!!
1518,I want to be a black women now
1519,Greetings dear one. At last there is  truth. Namaste' my sister.
1520,That’s video was super cool 
1521,That’s way to many WNBA “highlights” 
1522,How about you call out the CCP. Don't pretend you don't know about it.
1523,"Why was Simone Biles LEFT OUT ??? Since she was LEFT OUT, she'll LEAVE NIKE and sign up with ATHLETA. Congratulations Simone Biles and Athleta !!!!"
1524,Certainly no child abuse going on here.  Move along
1525,WNBA is not a sport 
1526,I see my sorors!
1527,This ain’t it chief
1528,Chinese Sweat Shops make the best work out apparel!
1529,Black History month already ended
1530,"@linearbrkdwn bro cool story bro, where you there or anyone you know there? Whites aren't the only colonist in our history right? Whites are among 1st to abolish slavery while Africa still has hundreds of THOUSANDS of slaves TODAY! Where is their voice? Oh, you're to busy holding grudges from 200 years ago...."
1531,@Jason Johnson and u should see what the whites did with Paradise after they did that to the Indigenous...
1532,"@Luis Martinez yes, I’m black. Hey do you think I care so much?"
1533,@Luis Martinez oh I thought you were talking about all black people instead of me
1534,@Luis Martinez Ironic how you’re talking about “ego” but are insulting black people.
1535,"@J A B if that were true it would be one of the main points of every person argument, I know quite a few and they have all talked about how they are taught to give them more room since they are stereotyped so hard, they almost expect to die every time the see a cop"
1536,@The Ecocosmos But racial profiling is a thing tho & I actually know of a few ppl who quit the police force bc they were specifically being trained to pull over African American & Hispanic looking ppl..
1537,@Papa Joᒐ what?
1538,@Papa Joᒐ rip knowledge
1539,"@The Ecocosmos Welcome to the new generation of brain-dead, brainwashed idiots who do not possess the ability to think for themselves."
1540,"@majime12 if he's white he has no need to be, the world is dominated by his kind. You like that??"
1541,@Gaming_SportsAaron 13 BURN LOOT MURDER 
1542,"@majime12 I have no reason to hate anyone unless they're a jerk, or are annoying, anything else I don't care about, political views, gender etc as long as they don't bother anyone im fine, but sometimes the demand for racism doesn't meet the supply, making this victim culture of ""oh this is happening because im black"" or ""oh I got pulled over because im black"" its ridiculous how obsessed everyone is becoming with race and trying to be more woke than one another"
1543,@The Ecocosmos I don’t “shove” it down people’s throats unless they get salty about it.
1544,"@majime12 why should it be for a month, its ridiculous, black lives do matter and everyone knows that, parroting it and shoving it down people's throats only negatively impacts that"
1545,@cyberbutterfly is african April next?
1546,@The Ecocosmos Because of our history? It’s called Black History Month for a reason.
1547,"@Wave dude there are a million reasons a cop could kill a balc person, very few are just because they're black, literally every other race gets killed, you saying black people are getting killed by cops because they're racist is basically just victimizing"
1548,@majime12 why should you get one then?
1549,@I like LeBron James not to be rude
1550,@I like LeBron James im a she
1551,"@Gaming_SportsAaron 13 it is all year around , till a cop kills another black person"
1552,@bo gard your the snowflake. Your assuming he hates blk people Bc he doesn’t want to get blm shoved down his throat. And he was saying black history month was over as a way to make fun of people who think black history should be just one month
1553,"@bo gard nah, im just tired of big companies trying market to us black women so we could buy their product"
1554,@majime12 I already have one and it ended like almost two weeks
1555,Okay and black women can’t get spotlight too
1556,Don’t be mad you don’t have a month dedicated to you.
1557,Black history isn’t just a month it goes all year around blm 
1558,Lmao so you hate blks so much that one commercial after blk history month gets your panties in a twist? What a snowflake
1559,Its melanin march now

1567,Well if it isn't the Gungan himself
1568,How bought the Chinese stop treating their people like crap!!!!
1569,And thats why i haven't bought nike garbage for years. Thats my magic trick
1570,This ad might make one think today is 1921....which it very isn't.
1571,Oh the company that makes its products in swear shops is talking
1572,"Stop supporting Nike. They are fast fashion meaning that they don't pay their workers enough even though they sell shoes and clothes for a high price. For example, they sell a pair of shoes for 100 but the worker gets around 18 cents or lower."
1573,Their racist ads hurt my brain
1574,Just came here to say I haven't bought Nike in years. Buy Under Armor or Addidas. Better quality anyways.
1575,Anybody know the name of the song used in this commercial and who made it.
1576,"Companies target demographics through advertising to maximise profits by getting each demographic in turn to buy their product; it has nothing to do with a political agenda, or the world being too left wing, nor is it about supporting the demographic they’re championing; it’s about the company trying to get you to buy their product.  They don’t care about you, nor do they intend to patronise you, yet repeatedly telling people they need empowering is very disempowering; don’t buy into that.  It is an untruth, aimed at getting you to buy their product, nothing more."
1577,When it comes to disliking JUST DO IT
1578,"The likes and dislikes are perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
1579,Serena turned in Tina Turner in the thumbnail
1580,"At least 100% of those women you have are abused. They weren't allowed to have children, and are overworked. Threatened to be fired if they don't comply."
1581,Yo my friends dad lives in China and he hasn’t called ever since he started working for you.
1582,Wahhhh  I needs help leveling playing feild cuz im inferior
1583,Nike attempting to make a shitty social commentary while using borderline slave labor in sweatshops.
1584,IS THE LFL STILL A THING?
1585,Former slaves to model your sweatshop products... classy.
1586,"They're so obsessed with the color of people's skin. It's not about what kind of person you are anymore, it's about the color of your skin. Sounds pretty bigoted to me."
1587,@Comedial I'm talking about in general. Many people on the left are like that.
1588,You missed the point my brother.
1589,Just stop it 
1590,"Let's start now. Buy products either locally made, NATO ally, or Non-NATO ally (Western friendly Japan, Taiwan, Australia)"
1591,Do they seriously want their sales to be horrendous?
1592,"If you want a level playing field for black women, or women in general, you should not fight for trans rights to choose what gender they want to play in. They must play for the gender they were born as, otherwise there won’t be women in women’s sports anymore."
1593,people wanna be oppressed so bad and this comment section proves it. Just say you’re racist and keep it movin .
1594,"Until one of the refs give them the call that they don't want for cheating, and then they just turn into a spoiled child."
1595,You’ll never address the sweatboxes will you?
1596,The head of my kawk is pink. I'm a person of color
1597,Ratio’dYOU LOVE TO SEE IT
1598,Anybody know the last girl they showed at the end running?
1599,"Lol, Having Caster Semaya, a hermaphrodite, in the ad right before the “trans lives matter” sign is rich...playing make believe with  “trans rights” people is going to destroy woman’s sports; you know, the thing the commercial should be about."
1600,"who needs this identity spotlight?  I sure don't.    Is this produced for people who feel underappreciated?  If so, I recommend they buy dogs.   Singling out groups like this is patronizing.   If you don't feel patronized when you see it, there's something wrong with you."
1601,I wanna see womens sports disappear. That's magic
1602,"For the next trick, let's make Nike disappear!"
1603,How many WNBA players can actually dunk tho? Like 2? Lol
1604,"Black women are absolutely recognized ALL THE TIME for their achievements.I mean isn't Selena Williams the superstar of women's tennis?What kind of woke, divisive BS is this?"
1605,"It’s just black and women supremacist propaganda, that’s all."
1606,Level the playing field for Uighur Muslims.
1607,"I wonder how soon they’ll delete the likes, dislikes, and comments on this ad? Soon? I think soon."
1608,Im SORRY But I Going To Keep It REAL! Time And Time Again This Always Have Been Genetic Proven Among Us PERIOD!...Again SORRY just keeping it REAL!..
1609,Sweatshop loving virtue signaling company at it's finest.
1610,why the need to focus on one specfic race?
1611,Support kids making nike goods! Lol!! But its all about you not child labor laws.
1612,So glad I don’t buy these shoes any more
1613,What about Asian women? Why don’t I see acknowledgment for them?
1614,@aldair martinez are you suggesting everyone changes who they’re attracted to lmao
1615,They are already the most desired mates in dating standards stop it
1616,All I can think of is the slave labor in China that makes these expensive sneakers it’s really disgusting
1617,What is the name of the song in the background?
1618,"The only thing that bothers me are the patronizing comments from white people (or whatever race) about black people “begging” for representation. So many comments mocking us for being in several advertisements and calling it “pity”. Or the condescending comments about how we beg for opportunity from several companies to be in these commercials. Worst part is, it’s true. We demanded to be “represented” and now- everyone is mocking us for being “woke”. So many patronizing comments under one ad. It’s disheartening... mainly because their true colors are showing and this is truly how they feel about us..."
1619,I'm surprised the woke crowd hasn't called national woman's day transphobic yet
1620,How about the men dominating the women’s sports?
1621,I identify as black female. Now give my money you bigots  #yaaaasssssssqween
1622,Where's Simone Biles?
1623,Man I love Nike products but that whole woke social marketing needs to chill
1624,"Nike""Boy, with all these new testosterone fuelled women around, were going to need to make bigger women's shoe sizes"""
1625,Black Women are Magical
1626,Found the Simp
1627,Crap company. End of story. Trump 2020 & 2024.
1628,"Serena dominated her sport for years, wtf is with this woke ""level the field"" garbage?"
1629,It’s gonna be really funny when these “black women” have to compete with white transgender “women.” I wonder who Nike will side with though
1630,"Why don't you use that thing to get a job and teach your kid's right from wrong,instead of boasting and showing off"
1631,Nike Trying to sell more overpriced sweatshop trash through virtue signaling and pandering.
1632,Nike if you were serious about the  helpping  you could move the factories out  of china and build them in  one of the dieing citys here in the USA. Like Chicago.
1633,"@J A B no you're just too ignorant to know when you're being sold bs by a company with blood on it's hands, but I don't blame you the media is good at brainwashing blacks"
1634,@Jayvion Leftwich Lol.. Ppl jus bold w/ it.
1635,@Embrace Masculinity just say you racist and keep it pushing
1636,No not good. Pretty bad actually.
1637,How are the people in your sweatshops doing Nike? I’ll stick to my vans and adidas.
1638,Can we please stop being preached to? PLEASE
1639,It should have Lebron in that helicopter
1640, Nike is so cringe
1641,"Incoming flood of right wingers to cry about boycotts, when these same people were supposedly already ""boycotting"" LOL "
1642,Anyone caught kneeling for the anthem gets the jogger flogger 5000.
1643,Lol what do you mean level the playing field? Blacks are way over represented in american sports as it is 
1644,Oh so that is why I still get black history month ads in March
1645,@Embrace Masculinity  I completely agree
1646,"There is no black history month, now we live in a dystopian society where it’s black history year and we are continually forced to acknowledge the superiority of colored people."
1647,ok ok 2 thousands dislikes I thought I was the only one
1648,What's with all the self segregation?
1649,Wait I’m confused why is everyone mad in the comments??? (no hate to the ppl in the comments i actually have no idea)
1650,Always crying wahhhhh wahhhhh ww victims
1651,Nike sponsors Victim Olympics.
1652,I'm just here for the comments.
1653,"Level the playing field?  So what, they want less black women in sports or something?"
1654,"So, no trans in Black Women's sports?"
1655,Title correction we play for pooh
1656,Dont know why being a black woman is so important. Enough of this nonsense. Your accomplishments are more important than your race. Should we celebrate people for having eyebrows next? How about people with large feet?
1657,Just think of the little Chinese children
1658,"Great at sports, but can't figure out how to use the internet..."
1659,"Funny because men are biologically built different, so how is allowing biological men playing in women’s sports leveling the playing field for biological women? Sorry, just “following the science” here."
1660,@via shaw Using an overused buzzword is not in and of itself an argument.
1661,@via shaw As Too You Bro lm SORRY But VardaoftheStars An Xoxo Absolutely Correct To A Degree Why Because l do To Work In Science An Sports Understanding Biology Of The Body But I Suggest That You Should Get Back Up On Your Studies Be Cool Bro!
1662,"@via shaw you need to learn anatomy and physiology. Men and women, are built biologically different - from muscle structure, bone structure, and even where fat is located. How many women can even reach a height of 7ft? Cause theres not many out there in comparison to men. It’s basic ‘science’ and you people think hormone replacers will change the biological structures in people. God you people are beyond dumb. This is why we shouldn’t let liberals teach in schools. They’d rather teach politics than actual PROVEN MEDICAL science"
1663,@via shaw oh jesus christ. Surgery doesn’t change your muscle structure. Dear God please take basic biology again. This is the problem with you all - you say “follow the science” until it actually matters! Hormones have 0 to do with how men can dominate womens sports. You literal child
1664,Ever heard of surgery? They can change their body using hormone don't be a transphobe
1665,Boycott nike and their sweatshop products
1666,Have black ppl not been dominating in pretty much every sport for the past 60 years? I’m confused.
1667,What is the background song?
1668,How about we all get shoes instead of just black women? This ruined Nike for me.
1669,YouTube lol yeah slavery is okay
1670,@AlexofAwesome Yes
1671,"It’s fine as long as it conforms to their opinions so they don’t have to see us little people. Why do you think they’re so obsessed with making everyone who disagrees out to be a bot, troll, or bigot."
1672,Does anybody know the font that is used?
1673,Never had a pair of Nikes...never will.... I simply do not support slavery.
1674,What is the song playing underneath?  It's making me crazy!!!
1675,"@Paul Mollan Just curious, is that what happened when you tried it?  Because I found the song by playing this video on my iPad and using Shazam on my phone.   I guess it's hit or miss whether or not it picks it up."
1676,@Two Pyramid BTW Shazam only recognizes the commercial not the tune within.
1677,@Two Pyramid Thank you!!!  It was making me crazy!
1678,"Ramsey Lewis - Les FleurBy the way, if you like finding out about songs, give the Shazam app a try."
1679,Strong woman! STRONG BLACK WOMAN!
1680,We play real. Real bad
1681,An ad nobody asked for from a company that makes it's products in China.
1682,"What is the original song playing in the background ? It’s. 70s song , I thought it was tina turner"
1683,Man.... what's that song playing???
1684,What song is this? I’ve heard it before.. sounds like Dionne Warwick but I can’t place it. HELP! 
1685,Where are all Hispanics at we of color too
1686,These comments tho.
1687,Based comments.
1688,Guess no other race of women matter compared to Nike 
1689,I love the CCP!
1690,@Armed Disks am I wrong?
1691,China is dope tho. They do what’s best for business
1692,cool
1693,So at what point have we worshipped them enough? Equal rights were achieved long ago. We had a black president. The demand for racism now GREATLY exceeds the supply.
1694,"“You think history just made it self nah baby this ain’t magic this,this is the real thing” that’s sounds like someone who is strong and brave would say "
1695,"Black trans lives matter.. Give me a break.  This newage ""woke"", pc, corny society we live in is annoying. I bet there's knucklehead people out there who think trans athletes who were once men, should be able to compete against real women."
1696,Don't buy nikes they fall apart or they just aren't what they used to be
1697,Un-be-weave-able.
1698,"The best player in the WNBA, player isn't t better than the worse male college basketball player"
1699,"uh level the playing field for Asian Basketball players,for Jewish Hairbraidersfor more Mexican Running backs in football ,intergnder , MMA BOXING ,NFL"
1700,Yeah cause if there is one thing in sports is not enough black women
1701,What's funny to me is most of the professional athletes are democratic and now women has to compete against men how did y'all look like y'all was government
1702,What song is in the background. Reminds me of the movie US
1703,Minnie Riperton - “Les Fleurs”Played right before and into credits
1704,Not enough womxn representation
1705,Hope those kids in the camps in China play real
1706,U play real but women sports dont generate enough revenue to pay well then blame men wen its women that dont support women sports that are responsible for them not generating women support urself before u blame others
1707,This vid has more dislikes than likes
1708,We play real.CRAPPY
1709,Nice pandering
1710,How about not letting men play in women sports. Lmao.
1711,Where is a video for all women? The day before international women's day let's post a video about black women... This is not inclusive.
1712,Adda quickly finds out
1713,I came here for the comments and I was not disappointed.
1714,"I thought women and blacks already fought for their rights decades ago? I don't know why I do, but I sense an entitled mentality behind this ad."
1715,"It’s funny how every commercial has to have a black person in it, it’s funny how all these companies are acting like they care about black peoples to make sales ! I stopped buying over priced Nike products years ago !"
1716,"If the playing field were ever truly equal the WNBA wouldn't exist being that they don't, and have never, made a profit. It is financially supported by the NBA... If we are being completely honest you would be hard pressed to find a female league that is equal to, if not supported by, it's male counter part... Stop it Nike... ""Level playing fields"" would all but end professional women sports."
1717,Just black women......?
1718,These comments are so racist it’s ridiculous. If you’re not standing with black women what did you even watch this video for??? Pls stay mad & we’ll stay magical 
1719,"What a nice low IQ, where did you get it? "
1720,"Careful, your insecurities are showing... "
1721,@dev literally nothing but fan behavior!!
1722,Exactly. They hate black women but are the first ones commenting on the videos... fan behavior if you ask me lmao
1723,@Balkan babo @Sleepy Make sure you both wear your white hoods in public and not just in the YouTube comments 
1724,MMMMHMMM U TELL DEM SISTA WE IZZZ MAGIKALLLL OOOOH GIRL LET ME TELL YOUUU 
1725,It’s almost like big corporations actually don’t care about peoples problems or actual equality and are just worried about making money.
1726,I hate that my favorite Ramsey Lewis' song was used in this... smh
1727,"Black women are given the opportunity in the limelight. Plus, why not shine a light on the fact that you all paying Chinese people a penny a day for your shoes"
1728,Another reason I do no support Nike.
1729,Talk to your buddy Biden about level playing fields.
1730,Why are they saying level the playing field. 95% of the WNBA is black. The playing field needs to be leveled for other races.
1731,@Camille Fajardo It took me a while to figure it out too. Was bugging me!
1732,U are literally the best!!! That little tune was stuck in my head and I’ve been searching everywhere for the name. Ur a god send)
1733,That __ thing. Thousand likes and I’ll fill in the blank
1734,Do you sell mens shoes?
1735,Haha!! What nonsense. Who the the hell wears Nikes besides “peaceful protesters”.
1736,I wonder what the real ratio is. 11M views but only 7K reacts? Yeah right......
1737,When Nike supported Colin is that what pissed you people off. Stop complaining
1738,Are you all worried about the sweatshops that you keep speaking of when you buy your new pair of Jordans? Smh. I just think people are made that Joke is acknowledging these women in a positive manner. Very few people/organizations show black women in a positive light. Smh.
1739,"Nice low IQ by the way, where did you get it? "
1740,Nike hires africans for their commercials because the job doesn't require thinking 
1741,"China is known for human rights violations. Black peoples in America are fine. Stop complaining, that or go to Africa and see how they treat you there"
1742,Get out of Lala Land Nike. Just make shoes nobody asked for your beliefs.
1743,Does anyone know who is the woman narrating this? Her voice is so beautiful.
1744,A low-key mockery of black women !!!
1745,All y’all sayin sweat shop shoes but y’all know u got a pair of nikes at the crib. And ur just saying negative stuff just to cause problems. Do u really look at a shoe and say a Chinese sweat shop worker made that? Or do u buy it without making a second thought? Either way I doesn’t matter.
1746,"I hate that nike approves of cultural appropriations...name me one black sport we still play today? Thats right, zero."
1747,People having sympathy for China yet they the same ones who tried to blame blacks for covid and kept them out of business and beat them. But y’all worried about them making shoes while y’all wearing clothing from companies where the clothes were made in China or Vietnam under the same conditions? Get y’all priorities right
1748,Genuinely disgusting.
1749,"Wow, it's funny because YouTube comments never cease to disappointment and amaze me, whether it be racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or anti semitism.  It's always somehow there and albeit sad it's entertaining to read the ramblings of hateful people"
1750,"Oh crap, we got a live one here."
1751,Pardon me if I don’t give a $&@% about your approbation of my view regarding Nike’s absurd attempt at virtue signaling about “leveling the playing field” when they’re siding with an agenda that allows biological males to dominate women’s sports.
1752,"@Bill Kekler I mean that's because inclusive and ads that show support generate the best pr. You do realize that corporations only care about money right?  Like they don't actually care either way about people.  It's just that we now live in a society where people like the idea of people being treated equal. As for the media, they just like sensationalism and division but they don't care either..However judging by your profile picture and comment, I have a feeling that you think this is all about a big agenda created by group j to take down group w right?  And one of the ways they do that is through feminism and the LGBTQ+?"
1753,@TCT I know what it means but I don't see how it's something you criticized me over?
1754,"@ACE CLOP They get this pandering all year. It was also America that freed them. Historically blacks have never been better. They have every big corporation, all media, and the mentality unhinged behind them all because they are 'oppressed'."
1755,@xoxo That's not how that works but ok
1756,@Bill Kekler That's mainly because historical in America they haven't been treated the best and you can call this type of ad cringey pandering but it's not exclusive because it's not putting anyone down it's just giving praise to an underrepresented minority during women's history Month
1757,@TCT What does that mean?
1758,@ACE CLOP you are a child and you don’t realize that allowing men in womens sports destroys the entire point of womens sports. I’m not going to argue with a child because clearly you’re under the delusion of wokeism. I hope you grow up and grow some brain cells while you’re at it.
1759,"@ACE CLOP This isn't inclusivity. This is black superiority. I don't see any other race, be it Irish, Russian, or Korean. There is a complete lack in diversity and inclusion in all media."
1760,"@xoxo I mean, I'm pretty sure most people don't care one way or another however the only people who take offense and get triggered over it are people who were already hateful.  Like most normal people will look at this and think &quot; That's kool, I guess &quot; and then go on about their day however the people who get mad over this and then go out of their way to complain about how society is changing are the people who too invested. Also ironically enough these types of comments are the reason for these commercials in the first place. I mean, I'm not really sure what your problem with inclusivitiy is though?"
1761,"Maybe it’s because all of you snowflakes don’t live in the real world, and if you did youd realize that NO ONE SUPPORTS THIS, except for the twitter echo chamber of “all inclusitivioty” until it means there’s only one group left."
1762,Just here to give my thumbs down
1763,What about China?
1764,CRINGE
1765,whether your white black green red orange yellowwe can all agree this commercial sucks
1766,How about no thanks
1767,You also play Chinese sweatshop simulator
1768,Why y'all put the WNBA in here... deadass ..
1769,To show how “woke” they are.
1770,Wait till the men show up! Thanks creepy JOE!
1771,Jesus loves everyone
1772,When is that Uighur commercial gonna drop?
1773,LOL the dislikes
1774,I think Martin Luther King would be disappointed
1775,"Nike is literally one of the worst companies out there for human rights, but ok."
1776,Scroo Nike and child labor
1777,Born male
1778,This is racist where is asian and white players at ?
1779,"Naomi Osaka is asian well half, but shes definitely not black."
1780,@James Jones ancient Egyptians were not white.
1781,@Juice J How do you know I was born in the wrong era? And how do you know this is a good era ?
1782,@Duka & Gjini Which is why I didn't use the term race goofball !! I specifically said ethnicities which would refer to the far more abundant ethnic groups tht are in this world.
1783,@J A B I only know three races white black and Asian that exist in this world and we have two genders male and female
1784,Are those the only other 2 ethnicities tht make up this planet?? Like why does everybody keep saying tht?
1785,They only want to promote the transgender narrative to the black population. That's what this was really about.
1786,So black women can’t have the spotlight for once
1787,@James Jones didn't White's take a whole Black Continent for themselves? Or how about Apartheid in South Africa.. 
1788,"@bo gard yep, black Egyptians used slaves to build the pyramids."
1789,"Lmao so blks cant have 1 commercial in America? Y'all whitewashed everything. I've seen movies about Egypt starring white ppl. Or how about white Jesus? ""How dare they make 1 commercial celebrating blk women, now back to my all white commercials"""
1790,fo years whites females got praise for black females work.. begolli u was just Born in the wrong era 
1791,@Evan Petelle They have succeeded tho.
1792,"@Dogmeat oh I forgot, I’ve never seen a black female athlete succeed Gtfo & stop taking the bait that is division."
1793,In the spotlight already
1794,Kneel b4 us white people
1795,"If this is for Black Woman, why is there a man in this commercial competing?  HE is destroying all of the WOMAN in the event, yup that's fair! 0025"
1796,What song is this
1797,That racial fetishism is absolute cringe
1798,No one This comment section How about those Chinese sweatshops Nike?
1799,"@Succaroni and Cheese, no one asked for your comment."
1800,@ShadowReaper2006 Here’s one for you No one asked for your opinion
1801,The “No one” in memes is useless.
1802,What about the sweat shops this ad is a joke
1803,Comments open. Just. Do. It....
1804,These slogans don't mean anything .
1805,You missed bhm
1806,Trans women....reversing all that progress for biological women.
1807,Sweat factory!! Never buy
1808,More dislikes than likes... hmmm... I wonder who is behind this ad...
1809,y'all are mean for no reason
1810,@jupiter ...because Nike has back an agenda of letting biological male dominate women’s sports.  This is the opposite of “leveling the playing field”.
1811,@Embrace Masculinity I know it isn't rainbows and shine but why are they being so hateful on this video in particular.
1812,"It’s not being mean, it’s telling the truth. Life isn’t sunshine and rainbows, honey."
1813,"If you could magically make things float, maybe we’d see more dunking in the WNBA..."
1814,"How do you level the playing field for women if Men can compete against women ,in women’s sports now? Also I didn’t know that blacks were the only people that played sports?? Rascist commercial if I’ve ever seen one"
1815,@matthew price yes we did black women used to not be able to play sports
1816,"@cyberbutterfly Ppppffffttt That is how you're going to start a conversation, with the pathetic race card? Truly you feel entitled. Carry on.."
1817,"""Blacks"" you mean black people we are people that's how I know your racist right there you mind as well have said a slur"
1818,@PraiseTheAlmightyGod are you racist you seem to be against anything about black people
1819,@J A B it’s March now
1820,@bo gard Giving anyone praises in general is disgusting. Especially to people that beg to be pandered too.Nice try on using religion for bait though. Extremely pathetic to bring it to any conversation.
1821,@PraiseTheAlmightyGod lmao so giving blk women praise is disgusting? That's so Christian of you
1822,@J A B  https//youtu.be/M5uYCWVfuPQYou you like oppressing women. Hahahahahahahaha!!!!

1831,@matthew price And are we talking about who made AMERICA or those who had an impact (significantly)??
1832,"@via shaw Don't reply to me, and don't bring me back to this video ever again. This disgusting pandering has to stop one day."
1833,@PraiseTheAlmightyGod I just don't understand your point is all !! BUUUUT I'm pretty sure what I just did there was make an opinionated statement which you were also quick to judge/ add your 2 cents ... The hypocrisy !!
1834,@J A B they didn’t change the game America was built on the backs of rich white men such as our president.
1835,@PraiseTheAlmightyGod you too
1836,"@J A B Are you a robot, you seem to be really against people opinions on how they feel about this pandering."
1837,Ever heard of Black History Month?? Literacy JUST passed... Tht whooole month ppl usually see commercials n other things JUST like THIS!! Ig it's not in season anymore to pay respect to some of the African American ppl who changed the game smh kmsl .
1838,May get a gift Its gonna be my birthday also I can be your Turkey Model
1839,We have went so Woke that these feminists athletes are now posting pictures of their period on their Instagram stories
1840,Western civilization is dead.
1841,Omg you human beings in the comments section are pitiful. Y’all really know how to make a negative from a positive  there’s no hope for you
1842,"What a nice low IQ, where did you get it"
1843,004 you'll float too
1844,What’s the name of the song?
1845,Might recognize it from the end of “US.” Took me about an hour before finding it lol
1846,Where are the men? Do you hate them?
1847,WE PLAY REAL..... BORINGLY and SLOW and STIFF
1848,Who is the women at 035
1849,Jesus and God is alive and love you repent
1850,Jesus and God is alive and love you repent
1851,New Balance is better anyway
1852,I came here for the comments
1853,New Nike stuff that is Dry?  https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJiEEXyzlH8
1854,Blacks everywhere....over exactraction
1855,"The only way to Heaven is to be born again by saying out loud &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; and believing in ur heart that God rose Him from the dead then you must live for Him i suggest getting baptized, repenting(asking for forgiveness of your sins and making a radical turn from ur sin), fasting (doesnt have to be from food), evangelizing(spreading the Gospel), praying, and reading the Bible. God and Jesus love all of you hmu with any questions have a good day God bless good works dont get u to Heaven God's grace does John 316Colossians 26Romans 109"
1856,Nike is complete trash
1857,Did everyone just come here to talk about Chinese kids? Bruh y’all missing the point of the video smh
1858,In my opinion only woman’s Tennis is the only sustainable woman’s sport that can bank roll itself. The MLB didn’t want to have to pay for another league to stay afloat so that’s why there’s no WMLB
1859,JB46 just ruined women’s sports but you all voted for that Progress. Ironic
1860,045 thats a man in a wig
1861,Can we stop the period pictures on your guy’s instagrams it’s getting disgusting
1862,"@hiolivia it’s disgusting people are making memes all about it, like we get your a woman but nobody wants to see that"
1863,she that female throw up the devil horns 17 sec
1864,No thanks.
1865,"l could be wrong, but don’t African Americans make up the majority of professional sports? I’ve also heard Nike uses sweatshops but I haven’t looked into they"
1866,CHINA
1867,"Black and and white people are the same, stop trying to divide."
1868,Are you telling me my children aren't competitive on their own and they need the field leveled for them? So disrespectful.
1869,Surprised they didn't disable comments...
1870,They surely will soon enough.
1871,Woman moment....
1872,Block block and block block and report
1873,God they are least attractive group ever
1874,Every black male I know have one thing in common.... their girlfriend isn't black.
1875,So 1 blk man? Didn't know he represents all blks
1876,Is that a dude at 026??
1877,@J A B and as you see it’s still nit even close in the race.  When a man goes through puberty it’s never even close to the same thing.  Bone density skeletal muscle is way higher.  And their levels of Test is stil more than 5X the average. Eventually there will be entire teams of these and not a real woman in sight.  If the imagery switch does level the playing field the why are there NO woman-men winning sports?  It’s insane to think this is ok
1878,"@Flo- Pride She actually got a procedure done to lower her testosterone levels below what a Male typically has and was actually doing not as well bc of it.. Quite a few ppl like her have done the same or just retired all together, but it's whatever... You all have a GREAT night !!"
1879,@Gaming_SportsAaron 13 nope it’s a dude. Growing your hair out doesn’t make you a chick.
1880,"@J A B No, it’s still a Dude.  DNA says different.  “HE” and others will be the destruction of women sports. Look at how far he is from the real women."
1881,@Flo- Pride no it’s a girl you see the hair in the back yea it’s a girl they don’t have to always look like a girl by their breast ok.
1882,@Flo- Pride Okay so it's actually Caster Semenya.. Who transitioned from Male to FEMALE sooo technically speaking she is indeed a Woman not a Dude.
1883,@Flo- Pride I still don't think it's a guy tho ...
1884,"@Flo- Pride I jus knew tht they mentioned she'd been part of the making of the whole ""We Play Real"" thing so I just assumed it must be her, but tht clip in the vid is def way older & def isn't heeeerrr .. Whoops !!"
1885,Nvm that's DEFINITELY not heeerrr !!! I'm tweeeeaaking .. Well pal you tell me!
1886,@Flo- Pride I'm pretty sure it's Sha'Carri Richardson.. I think .
1887,@J A B who is that then?
1888,He probably just joined the women’s team so now he’s considered a woman. That’s how messed up our country is
1889,I thought so too
1890,Wouldn’t be surprised at this point. That’s sad for me to say.
1891,Thash 
1892,nah wtf is this comment section
1893,It is called cynicism.
1894,@Peter113 he's telling it how it is right now smartass
1895,@Embrace Masculinity FIRST THEY CAME By Martin NiemöllerFirst they came for the Communists And I did not speak outBecause I was not a Communist Then they came for the Socialists And I did not speak outBecause I was not a SocialistThen they came for the trade unionists And I did not speak outBecause I was not a trade unionist Then they came for the JewsAnd I did not speak outBecause I was not a JewThen they came for meAnd there was no one leftTo speak out for me.
1896,"@Embrace Masculinity What do you mean by “now it’s against white people”. Are you implying racism was only acceptable when it was against a certain race? Racism is bad period. You shouldn’t only care about racism when it’s effecting your own kind. You’re part of the problem. Keep that same energy when people are disrespecting Asians, Natives, Blacks, etc.. and maybe more people will show you some damn consideration. Who the hell do you think you’re? Why are you entitled to more thought compassion than everyone else?"
1897,"@Peter113 No you’re right. Racism does exist, but not against black people, it’s now against white people."
1898,"It’s full of truth, that’s what it is. You’ve been living in a bubble for so long that you’re scared of opposing opinions."
1899,@bo gard And people still claim racism doesn’t exist!!
1900,No fr this is so racist
1901,You mean no White people ;)
1902,Yo February is already over
1903,@J A B LMAO AND YOU OVER HERE NOW CRYING ABOUT A DAY LMAOOOO
1904,"@J A B Columbus was one of many conquistadors of that time. No country exists today that was not taken over by use of excessive force. If we had not expanded west than someone else would of, most likely Spain. Spain would have done the exact same thing if not worse. The west has created most of the modern technology we use today, besides from Germany.... they can be innovative. I celebrate Columbus Day because without him America wouldn’t have existed. He was a tough guy and he stood his ground on a land full of savages. If you think you can go back in time and tell him he was racial profiling then your an idiot."
1905,@Dogmeat Or do they ever think about how Blk History Month is the shortest month in the year??
1906,"@1911 And what about the story behind Thanksgiving? Everyone keeps bragging about how white ppl built America & hard work pays off, but what about the ppl tht actually did the hard work? Slaves & ppl native to said land tht white ppl ""built"".. Js..."
1907,@Dogmeat What about the Irish treatment in New York or how New Yorkers actively discriminated against Israelites?
1908,@1911 And when did I eeever state tht blk ppl couldn't celebrate Xmas or any other holiday?
1909,@1911 Columbus?
1910,@Gaming_SportsAaron 13 white people have a year? Wtf are you talking about. The way it IS is every month is normal except for February when you get your recognition that you apparently want and need so desperately and blm ooohhh yayyy burn loot destroy good yes
1911,@J A B Yeah yeah yeah white privileged my ass. Being white hasn’t done a damn thing for me. Wdym white people have holidays year round? Black people cant celebrate Christmas now?
1912,@Mike J Tht's ppl's problem they wanna confine Black recognition to one month!! Did anybody care to realize that Black History Month is the shortest month out of the whoooole year??? Like Black ppl can't have too much shine bc that's a problem even tho society/the white man has suppressed them for years?
1913,@1911 Schools teaching about Black History is coming to be less heard of in recent years.. I for one can say tht when I was in school the most we heard about black history was during slavery.
1914,@1911 White ppl have holidays year round AND white privilege what more is there to give?
1915,"@1911 These fools will never get it.. No point in even trying lol.. its funny and pathetic, though"
1916,@Voxy Blog Do we praise George Washington for leading our county though the revolution or do we praise him because he is white? Now do we praise George Floyd for putting a gun to a woman’s unborn child or do we praise him because he’s black?
1917,@1911 “white history month” is like everyday every year learn it in school more than anything else YALL literally get praised like black women have a moment then it’ll be back to y’all damn
1918,"@Dogmeat Really? They only teach about white people? That’s a load of garbage, schools teach about African Americans during the revolution, civil war, they learn about MLK, Langston Hughes, the Harlem renaissance, and figures like Harriet Tubman ext. I watched Glory when I was in history class, the movie about a black regiment during the civil war. Schools should teach kids about important figures in general. They have been though recently in this new revolution of wokeness we separate black history from white history and we divide ourselves even if the goal is too unite. Morgan freeman said it best black history is American history, and schools are not teaching their kids about Thomas Jefferson just because he is white."
1919,@Mike J white people don’t have a month they have a year and us black people only have a month
1920,@Mike J why are you so racist
1921,And black history is all year blm 
1922,"@via shaw No they certainly didn't. That was white people, y'all are just envious of us because we went to wars and died to make this country. None of the founding fathers or pioneers were black."
1923,@1911 white history month is literally every month. In school they teach you about white people every day. You ever think about that?
1924,"@via shaw Can we have a white history month to give recognition to the white people who built this country? Oh we can’t, because that would be racist. See the irony here?"
1925,"@J A B thats all, folks!"
1926,@via shaw you did..ya month is over now..foh
1927,And? Valck people built this country we can have some recognition
1928,THIS AD IS RACIST!
1929,Very racist
1930,Black black black black black......stop with the victimhood mentality
1931,@draft kingo it's annoying to see black people constantly acting like helpless victims. Poisoned culture
1932,awww someone mad
1933,Black people live in their own la la land
1934,Spot on
1935,"@Ready set React thats because half of the white race believes in white guilt which is pathetic. It goes deeper than the ""media"" the root cause is ""education"" mainly ""public education"""
1936,@Ooga Booga there are also a good amount of white blm supporters. They are just mislead by the media
1937,@Ready set React which is still the majority of their race soo....
1938,"Not all black people, only Black Lives Matter supporters"
1939,What about a white Nike commercial?
1940,Pandering and presumptuous
1941,Mighty pup toys video
1942,These comments are all hate Nike it’s not to late to delete this shitpost
1943,"The racism in the comment section, the passive aggression towards REAL representation just shows why we need stuff like this. I cried when i first saw this commercial and i knew that there would be backlash like this. Also, y'all don't care about the injustices happening in foreign countries, if you did you would be striking these big corporations for those reasons not because they have black people and women in their commercials."
1944,Who is the soccer player they show doing the fake.
1945,Way to put every other race down lol
1946,"@cyberbutterfly Blind sheep, stay separating us lol"
1947,I literally just say an ad for a Clorox commercial with an Asian man and said the same thing!! Like so racist 
1948,Explain how-
1949,"""How dare they make 1 commercial celebrating blk women? Now back to my all white commercials"" lmao"
1950,How is this putting them down literally just say you hate black women
1951,Nike is trash! Adidas is better
1952,Kb on the
1953,Nike is the worst ever
1954,This is racist
1955,@Bill Kekler But does tht make it racist?? It's just showcasing the achievements of African American ppl just as other commercials/ads do for other races..  And it was just Black History Month so maybe something to do w/ tht.
1956,@Bill Kekler Fix black ppl's problems 4 them how?
1957,@Bill Kekler Other way around pal -_- ..
1958,"Yes, they do get represented, but it's unproportional and in a negative way. I almost never see Asian people in advertisements despite them being six percent of the population, half of black people, yet I see mostly black people in advertisements. When I do see white people they're usually just a background character or used as a joke, especially the men."
1959,@Bill Kekler yea because white people ain’t like black people dummy
1960,@Bill Kekler Asian and whites get represented whites most of all get represented way more than POC’s your point is
1961,"@Gaming_SportsAaron 13 Yes y'all did and white people had to fix that for y'all too because you couldn't fix your own problems. Adding onto that, America was a predominantly white country, and a great one at that, so you would ofcourse see mostly white people. There were more white actors and it was proportional to the population."
1962,@Bill Kekler white people did us like this back in the day and Asians and did we have a problem?
1963,"@bo gard It depends on context. This advertisement is airing in America, therefore I can assume that it takes place there. Blacks make about thirteen percent of the population, yet one hundred percent of the people here are black. That's over representation. If this was a documentary about Africa or another mostly black area, that would make sense. There's the problem."
1964,"@Bill Kekler lmao with that logic then all the commercials, TV shows and movies with only white ppl are racist, right?"
1965,Your racist because you hate black women
1966,"@J A B Notice the complete lack of white people and asians in general. I see no Irish man, Russian, or American. There are zero Koreans, vietnamese, or Iranians. I didn't even see a single Kekistani, a super minority! This video makes everything about the blacks and leaves everyone else out. Not very inclusive, don't you say?"
1967,"Stupid racist commercials, this is ridiculous and hypocritical, absolutely racist"
1968,sshaddup...thumbs down
1969,Where's the White people?
1970,Working
1971,Cringe
1972,Third
1973,Its ok because they are black and women
1974,@Voxy Blog They have been having a “moment” for almost half a year now.
1975,What black women can’t have a moment
1976,Ccp founded
1977,I wrote MAGA OR TRUMP 2024 on all my Nike shoes
1978,"Where are the other athletes besides black, Nike is so racist, cancel nike"
1979,Why are y’all so mad and racist
1980,@Omar Jones this man is just bitter asf
1981,@I like LeBron James no it’s not bro wtf
1982,@I like LeBron James no it dosent that how you took it..sad
1983,We’re not racist the ad is. It’s trying to say that black women have something better than everyone else
1984,"Speaks mangled English. No engineers, surgeons or scientists shown. And of course, it's all somebody else's fault. You go, grrrrrl."
1985,@Curly Tells Oh snap! He dropped big facts and you got nothin! Truth hurts
1986,@Curly Tells My white friends are already well aware of it. Pity your black friends aren't.
1987,@John Koenig seems like you have a lot to say  tell that bs to your white friends lmaooooooooo
1988,"@Curly Tells They don't seem to matter much to fellow black people, dear. You're killing yourselves wholesale. The biggest threat to black America isn't some moron wearing a white sheet with a pointy hat on his pointy head, it's some Fitty-cent wannabe brandishing his &quot;nine&quot; sideways. Black America is self-destructing. A black student who excels academically risks being  reviled and abused for &quot;acting white&quot;. The illegitimacy rate tops 70%. Millions of little boys are being raised without fathers, with no one to teach them how to be a man.Those things matter infinitely more than empty slogans. Perhaps you should rethink your priorities."
1989,@Curly Tells AMEN!!!
1990,@John Koenig only thing I forgot to add was BLACK LIVES MATTER 
1991,"@Curly Tells You misspelled ""realism""."
1992,Your racism is showing 
1993,First
1994,@Thomas More Dude why??
1995,First idiot
1996,"This is cool and all but as far as NBA/Football don’t act like your all that and say you could beat boogie one on one, also don’t be entitled by thinking you should earn as much as lebron or a max contract. The nba is the only reason why they haven’t been shut down 10 years ago.if you don’t bring in the money don’t act like you deserve it. Other than that hiccup it’s good to be confident and they can/do kill it in other sports"
1997,First
1998,"Warning  This comment section is beyond toxic/racist so just scroll back up if you don’t want your mood ruined. If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all.We support Black Women around here. Hate has no place here."
1999,@Embrace Masculinity what truth? Black women in society are all viewed as ghetto loud and viewed at the bottom at the barrel. You always complain “ well white ppl are being uplifted” because there’s no reason to. Eurocentric beauty is the standard and yall are also the majority. People like you just love to think we just live in a post racist society when we don’t and we are far from it.
2000,"Labeling it with a buzzword is not a very good argument. What you’re seeing is the truth. The truth might be a little scary to you since you live in a bubble but it’s still the truth. I support everyone, but I don’t support black supremacy or reverse racism against whites (or just racism)."
2001,THANK YOU!
2002,Fourth
2003,Love Nike for supporting black culture
2004,"You've been brainwashed, my friend."
2005,loool.. You really think they support black culture lol? They only support your dollars $$$$$
2006,This is racist there was no one other than blacks
2007,"@Jayvion Leftwich Yeah, guess that was a slip up . Lmao "
2008,@Peter113 I don’t think I have seen an all white commercial I have also never seen a white history month or a race other than black
2009,Do you say the same in majority white commercials or is your bigotry just showing?
2010,cringe.
2011,I LOVE this commercial Edit Plz stop being negative in the comments. I just think this commercial is AMAZING because it is acknowledging under-represented black women in sports.
2012,"@J A B where are the working hard Asians, Muslims, Whites??  Are they just ignore them like they are nothing??  Why can't you get that"
2013,@Batman But it isn't..
2014,Say goodbye to woman’s sports because idiots like you think biological men have the same skill sets as woman.
2015,@Batman it’s not racist at all
2016,J A B it's racist and dumb
2017,What I wanna know is why everybody is hating in the comments??!
2018,"The crowded blouse problematically like because wave impressively encourage given a wide property. tightfisted, far toe"
2019,Shout out to women across the world!!!! Love you all!!!!!
2020,This is pathetic...
2021,@Dogmeat I concur my N1€€@...
2022,@J A B You mean my point? You sad bruh. The bigger picture Hahahahaha! Just because something is shoved in your face doesn't mean it's ... Hahahahahahahaha you're useless!
2023,"@Embrace Masculinity Thank you. As a person of color, I must say It is very sad seeing the lack of common sense applied to these obvious distractionary propaganda filled ads by corporations that make fake claims of enlightenment these days while still abusing people to make their profits. But hey, they made a commercial so it's all good. Such simple minds ripe for manipulation calling themselves adults. This is sad...Hahahahahahahaha! Oh well, I'll be alright."
2024,@Embrace Masculinity You must be stupid or you can’t read social cues but I was joking. I put the  there for a reason. Go to college and get a degree.
2025,"Stay strong, man. Don’t let these “woke” idiots get to your head."
2026,"@Dogmeat Ah yes, thinking an ad is pathetic definitely is the same as hating black people. God you people are stupid."
2027,And this comment is as pathetic as the person who typed it ..
2028,@Big Fisto And you my friend are pathetic bc you cannot see the bigger picture n meaning behind advertisement like THIS!
2029,@Voxy Blog I pity you. Enjoy abuse for your shiny shoes...
2030,@Big Fisto wait what the hell
2031,@Dogmeat Hahahahahahahaha... Exactly. You're a hell of a critical thinker. Bravo
2032,@Big Fisto you hate black ppl or something 
2033,Because it's visual and auditory Aaaaaaaaaaaiiiiidds! You're pathetic for having to ask. Stop replying to everyone and think next time kiddo...
2034,Why?
2035,Reported for encouraging terrorism.
2036,It’s not terrorism it’s just extremely racist.
2037,"90% of these comments are ignorant or racist. C'mon people. Don't be sorry. Be better.Thank you <a href=""http//www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nike"">#Nike</a> for recognizing the smartest, strongest and most underappreciated group in America black women."
2038,"@Jaime Silva Dude no ones talking about that, slave labor and child labor is of course wrong. I'm talking about the racism"
2039,So apparently criticizing Nike for profiting out of the blood and sweat of child laborers and Uyghurs in Chinese factories and then claiming to be an advocate of civil rights and making a commercial for blacks while not even helping blacks at the same time is racist and ignorant? The left thinks that they own you. Realize that
2040,"All this HATE in the comment section is REAL!!!  In spite of it all, keep Rising and Shining Black Women!!!  Thank you NIKE for acknowledging all this WONDERFUL BLACK GIRL MAGIC!!!  Your company will NEVER go under because Black People will continue to support you.  KUDOS!!!You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may tread me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.
Maya Angelou"
